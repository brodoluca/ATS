	Cars and small trucks have dominated transportation in the last century

	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Inefficient use of the infrastructure
	    \item Responsible for 60\% of $\text{CO}_2$ emissions in the EU (\cite{eea2023})
	    \item No more sustainable
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Traffic Management is Necessary }
	As vehicle ownsership increases, so do traffic inefficiencies. 
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Increased congestions $\rightarrow$ toll on the economy (1\% GDP of US (\cite{schrank2012}) )
		\item Increase consumption and pollution
		\item Elevated risk of accidents
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{ATSs Solve These Problems }
	Extend the concept of personalized and shared mobility to goods delivery.\\
	Three main pillars 
	\vspace{0.3cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ensured optimal quality of service (QoS)
		\item Optimized traffic control and road usage
		\item Minimized environment impact and operational costs
