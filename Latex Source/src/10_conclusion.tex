\chapter{Summary and Outlook}

In this work, we only considered one solution to solve the dispatching problem. While the solution found is guaranteed to be optimal, other algorithms could be used as well. For example, one possible approach is to develop an ad-hoc algorithm for it. For instance, requests could be assigned greedily to vehicles according to some heuristics, such as nearest neighbours, or according to the vehicle status, i.e. state of charge, capacity or traveling path. Requests should be assigned in such a way that are still in line with the previous path (see \figref{fig:sens_assignment}). One could, for example, consider as input the previously calculated path for it.
