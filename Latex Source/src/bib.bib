In general, this limitation is overcome by introducing planned detours to battery charging stations. Most existing E-VRP models assume that the battery-charge level is a linear function of the charging time, but in reality the function is nonlinear. In this paper we extend current E-VRP models to consider nonlinear charging functions. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed for this problem. To assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions, we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature. Our results suggest that neglecting nonlinear charging may lead to infeasible or overly expensive solutions. Furthermore, to test our hybrid metaheuristic we propose a new 120-instance testbed. The results show that our method performs well on these instances.}

	ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of vehicle-communication technologies, many researchers have strongly focused their interest in vehicle energy-efficiency control using this connectivity. For instance, the exploitation of preview traffic enables the vehicle to plan its speed and position trajectories given a prediction horizon so that energy consumption is minimized. To handle the strong uncertainties in the traffic model in the future, a constrained controller is generally employed in the existing researches. However, its expensive computational feature largely prevents its commercialization. This paper addresses computational burden of the constrained controller by proposing a computationally tractable model prediction control (MPC) for real-time implementation in autonomous electric vehicles. We present several remedies to achieve a computationally manageable constrained control, and analyze its real-time computation feasibility and effectiveness in various driving conditions. In particular, both warmstarting and move-blocking methods could relax the computations significantly. Through the validations, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach while maintaining good performance compared to other alternative schemes.},

	abstract = {While the constant current charge time (CCCT) and constant voltage charge time (CVCT) are increasingly used for the state of health (SOH) estimation of Li-ion batteries, their correlations with battery degradation are not investigated comprehensively. This paper develops an analytical model to quantify the chargeable capacity of a Li-ion battery under a CC-CV profile, in which CCCT and CVCT are identified as two uncoupled parameters. The model is verified using a battery dataset of cycling tests subjected to 19 different test conditions with different discharge currents, ambient temperatures, and rest times. The behaviors of CCCT and CVCT during battery degradation are studied in terms of chargeable capacity fade. A new health indicator, the CV-CC time ratio, is developed for degradation analysis. Two partial CC-CV cases are also considered in the studies: in one case, the partial CC-CV charge starts after different discharged depths, and in the other case, different fast charging policies are executed before the partial CC-CV charge.}

The problem is motivated by the real situation of a retail company and solved by an MIP solution approach. The MIP model reflects the interdependencies between inbound transportation, outbound transportation and instore logistics as well as capital tied up in inventories and differences in picking costs between the warehouses. A novel solution approach is developed and applied to a real-life case of a leading European grocery retail chain. The application of the new approach results in cost savings of 6% of total operational costs compared to the present assignment. These savings amount to several million euros per year. In-depth analyses of the results and sensitivity analyses provide insights into the solution structure and the major related issues.}

	abstract = {Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) could provide low-cost service to travelers and possibly replace the need for personal vehicles. Previous studies found that each SAV could service multiple travelers, but many used unrealistic congestion models, networks, and/or travel demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide a method for future research to use realistic flow models to obtain more accurate predictions about SAV benefits. This paper presents an event-based framework for implementing SAV behavior in existing traffic simulation models. We demonstrate this framework in a cell transmission model-based dynamic network loading simulator. We also study a heuristic approach for dynamic ride-sharing. We compared personal vehicles and SAV scenarios on the downtown Austin city network. Without dynamic ride-sharing, the additional empty repositioning trips made by SAVs increased congestion and travel times. However, dynamic ride-sharing resulted in travel times comparable to those of personal vehicles because ride-sharing reduced vehicular demand. Overall, the results show that using realistic traffic flow models greatly affects the predictions of how SAVs will affect traffic congestion and travel patterns. Future work should use a framework such as the one in this paper to integrate SAVs with established traffic flow simulators.}

	abstract = {Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ∼3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.}}

	abstract = { 9.1 Introduction In the VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD), a heterogeneous vehicle fleet based at multiple terminals must satisfy a set of transportation requests. Each request is defined by a pickup point, a corresponding delivery point, and a demand to be transported between these locations. The requested transport could involve goods or persons. This latter environment is called dial-a-ride. The objective function(s) generally minimizes system costs. The VRPPD with Time Windows (VRPPDTW) is a generalization of the VRPTW examined in Chapter 7. In the pickup (resp., delivery) version, the VRPTW is the particular case of the VRPPDTW where the destinations (resp., origins) are all at a common depot. Problems in this class involve time constraints that establish time intervals during which service must take place at each stop, or that express user inconvenience and maximum ride time restrictions for passengers. For example, time windows for dial-a-ride problems model preferred pickup and delivery times specified by the customers. In addition to time windows to be satisfied at each stop, the VRPPD involves several other sets of constraints. These impose visiting each pickup and delivery stop exactly once, not exceeding the capacity of vehicles, and coupling the pickup and corresponding delivery stops on the same vehicle routes and impose visit precedence among each pickup stop and its associated drop-off stop. There are also depot constraints that ensure vehicles return to the appropriate terminals and resource restrictions on the number of drivers and vehicle types. }

The optimal control problem, solved on-line, yields a ‘tube’ and an associated piecewise affine control law that maintains the controlled trajectories in the tube despite uncertainty; computational complexity is linear (rather than exponential) in horizon length. Asymptotic stability of the controlled system is established.}

In this paper we provide a non-technical introduction to the basic concepts of typed graph transformation systems, completed by a survey of more advanced concepts, and explain some of its history and motivations.}
