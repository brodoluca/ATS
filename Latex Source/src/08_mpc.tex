\chapter{Model Predictive Control of an ATS}\label{ch:mpc}
This chapter proposes a solution for the dispatcing, routing and rebalancing problems for ATSs in a different flavour, namely by designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) to regulate the system. This is motivated by the hinsights obtained in the previous chapter, which suggested that making decisions in the present have a great impact on the future. In \secref{sec:linear_discrete_time_model}, a novel model for the system is developed which, contrary to the previous one, is not graph based. Subsequentally, \secref{sec:prob_formulat_mpc} defines the MPC problem and a thorough discussion on the terminal set and on the terminal cost, which are essential to prove stability. In order to achieve this goal, the feasability of the terminal and of the states set are demonstrated. Finally, in \secref{sec:use_case_mpc}, a simulation is proposed to evaluate the overall performance of the system. 
\section{Linear-Discrete Time Model}\label{sec:linear_discrete_time_model}
The model derived in this section is partially inspired from \cite{zhang2016}. \\
Consider a transportation network be composed of $|\mathcal{V}|$ stations connected by a set of $|\mathcal{N}|$ roads and $|\mathcal{A}|$ multi-occupancy, goods-carrying vehicles. Within this context, customers are assumed to requests rides only from the abovementioned stations. Similarly, goods can be carried out only from one station to another. With this assumption, stations and customers can be considered synonims within this section. \\
Similarly to the model described in \chapref{sec:vc_model}, other than carrying goods or people, vehicle are expected to \textit{(i)} serve clients from one station to another and \textit{(ii)} reach locations in $\mathcal{V}$ in order to avoid system imbalance. For the rest of the section, a generic road $\langle i,j\rangle \in \mathcal{N}$ will be considered.\\
Let $d_{ij} \in \mathcal{R}_{\ge0}$ be the total lenght of a road $\langle i,j\rangle$. Let $v^a_{ij}(t) \in \{0,1\}$ indicate whether a transporting vehicle $a \in \mathcal{A}$ is moving from station $i$ to station $j$ ($v^a_{ij}(t) = 1$) and, likewise, $w^{a}_{ij}\in \{0,1\} $ whether an empty vehicle is moving from $i$ to $j$ ($w^{a}_{ij}(t)= 1$). Let $V_{ij}(t) \in \{ x \in \mathbb{N}_0 : x \leq |\mathcal{A}|$ being the total number of vehicles currently circulating on the street $\langle i,j\rangle$, this can be trivially expressed as in \equaref{eq:vehicles_on_street}. \\

\begin{equation}
	V_{ij}(t) = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} v^{a}_{ij}(t) +w^{a}_{ij}(t)
	\label{eq:vehicles_on_street}
\end{equation}

When a vehicle is in transit, it is essential to monitor the anticipated duration until it reaches its destination. In order to do so, let's assume the road $\langle i,j\rangle$ to have a speed limit $l_{i,j}$. Accordingly, since the system is dealing with fully autonomous vehicles, in a typical driving scenario, one can safely assume this to be the cruising speed as well. In other words, one can assume the vehicles to be driving with a speed $l_{i,j}$ over $\langle i,j\rangle$ in normal road conditions.  Motivated by safety concerns, the cruising speed cannot be consistently maintained at $l_{i,j}$ due to various factors. These factors may include road conditions, weather conditions, traffic density, or any unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, the actual cruising speed during the journey over road $\langle i,j\rangle$ may vary based on these dynamic elements, ensuring that the autonomous vehicles can adapt to changing conditions and prioritize safety over a fixed cruising speed. One factor which is directly controllable is the traffic density. Therefore, taking inspiration from the BPR model (\figref{fig:bpr_models_approx}), one can approximate the cruising speed according to the amount of vehicles on the road. More specifically, one can modify \equaref{eq:model_bpr_approximation} to reflect this condition, and therfore rewriting it as \\
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}	
		s_{ij}(V_{ij}) &= \begin{cases}
			l_{ij} \quad\quad &\text{if } V_{ij}\in[0,V_{ij}^{th})\\ 
			l_{ij} - b\cdot(V_{ij}^{th}- V_{ij}) \quad\quad &\text{if }V_{ij}\in[V_{ij}^{th}, V_{ij}^{max})\\ 
			0\quad\quad &\text{if }V_{ij} \ge V_{ij}^{max}\\ 
		\end{cases}\\
		\text{with } b  &=  \dfrac{l_{ij}-\epsilon }{ V_{ij}^{th} -  V_{ij}^{max}} \text{ and } \epsilon \in (0,1)
\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:model_bpr_approximation2}
\end{equation}
From the definition, it follows that $s_{if}$ is defined in the following domain $s_{ij}: \mathbb{N}_0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge eps}$.
An example can be seen in \figref{fig:speed_model}. The last case, i.e. when $V_{ij} \ge V_{ij}^{max}$, is inspired from the congestion model used in \secref{sec:vc_model} and in this case is modeling stale mate traffic. Intuitively, if too many cars are on the road, these will not be able to circulate with a high speed and eventually stop-and-go traffic will be created. In this case, vehicles will be modelled as circulating at a vary low speed. \\

	\label{fig:speed_model}
\end{figure}
This allows to effectively track the position of the vehicle in terms of time as well. However, the position should be tracked only if the vehicle is currently driving on the street. 
Therefore, position of the vehicle $a$ over $\langle i,j\rangle$ is propagated using \equaref{eq:position_propagation}. 
\begin{equation}
	x^a_{ij}(t+\delta) =\begin{cases}
		 x^a_{ij}(t) + s_{ij}(V_{ij}(t))\cdot\delta & \text{if } v^a_{ij}(t) + w^a_{ij}(t)= 1 \\
		 
		 0& \text{if } v^a_{ij}(t) + w^a_{ij}(t)= 0\\
		 0& \text{if }i=j \\
		 %0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	 \label{eq:position_propagation}
\end{equation}
As mentioned above, \equaref{eq:position_propagation} tracks the position of a moving vehicle, i.e. takes care of the state of moving vehicles. In addition to this, the model also needs to track the number of vehicles currently stationed in $i$. This is achieved by introducing an additional variable $f^a_i(t)$, which indicates whether a vehicle arrived at a station $i$. It is defined as following.
\begin{equation}
	f^a_{i}(t) =\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if }x^a_{ji}(t) \ge d_{ji}\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:station_propagation}
\end{equation}
This variable can be propagated by introducing two more variables, i.e. $p^a_{ji}$ and $g^a_{ji}$, to indicate wether a vehicle has departed or arrived at a station $i$, respectively. 
\begin{equation}
		f^a_i(t+1) =f^a_i(t) + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}}(g^a_{ji}(t) - p_{ij}^a(t)) 
		\label{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}
\end{equation}
\equaref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind} also ensures that a vehicle performs an action on the road $\langle i,j\rangle$ only when stationed at $i$.\\
The variables $p^a_{ji}$ and $g^a_{ji}$ are binary variables as well and their definition is as follows:
\begin{align}
	p^a_{ji}(t) =\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if }x^a_{ji}(t) \le d_{ji}\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:departed_variable}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
	g^a_{ji}(t) =\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if }x^a_{ji}(t) \ge d_{ji}\\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:arrived_variable}
\end{equation}
The propagation of $g^a_{ji} $ follows a straightforward pattern: if the variable is zero at time $ t $, it can become either one or zero at $ t+1 $, representing the possibility of the vehicle reaching a station or not. However, if $ g^a_{ji}(t) = 1 $ at time $ t $, then $ g^a_{ji}(t+1) = 0 $, indicating a reset.  The variable $ p^a_{ji}$ is not propagated, however its definition depends on time. Initially, at $ t=0 $, $p^a_{ji} $ is set to zero, implying no vehicle can start at time zero. At instant $ t+1 $,  $p^a_{ji} = 1$ only if the vehicle has moved at time $t$, but was stationed at time $t-1$, otherwise must remain zero\footnote{For a more comprehensive analysis and explanation, please refer to \secref{appendix:sec:propagation_g} and \secref{appendix:sec:definition_p}. }. \\
The definition in \ref{eq:arrived_variable} imposes that the vehicles must top if they reached a station. This is translated  in  (\ref{eq:prop_w}) and (\ref{eq:prop_v})
\begin{align}
	w_{ij}^a(t+1) &= \neg v^a_{ij}(t) \land \neg g^a_{ji}(t) \land \neg v^a_{ij}(t)  \label{eq:prop_w}\\
	v_{ij}^a(t+1) &= \neg w^a_{ij}(t) \land \neg g^a_{ji}(t) \land \neg w^a_{ij}(t) \label{eq:prop_v}
\end{align}
This formulation leverages the fact that all the above variables are binary. In simply words, this is enusring that a vehicle can only be rebalancing or driving only if it was performing the same action on the previous instance or if it has not arrived yet. In addition, also insures that if the vehicle reached a station, then it stops, i.e. $v^a_{ij}(t)=w^a_{ij}(t)=0$\footnote{Please refer to \secref{appendix:sec:const_w_v} for the derivation of these two constraints.}. 

%\begin{equation}
%	f^a_i(t+1) =f^a_i(t) + 1_{d_{ji} \leq x^a_{ji}(t)} - \sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}}(v_{ij}^a + w_{ij}^a) %1_{d_{ji} \neq x^a_{ji}(t)}
%	\label{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}
%\end{equation}

%\begin{equation}
%	f^a_i(t+1) = f^a_i(t) +1_{d_{ji} = x^a_{ji}(t)} - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}}( v^a_{ij} + w^a_{ij})
%	\label{eq:stationed_propagation}
%\end{equation}
%The function $1_x$ is commonly known as the indicator function, denoting a Boolean variable x that can take values {true, false}. Specifically, $1_x$ is defined as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%	1_x = \begin{cases}
%		1 & \text{if } x \text{ is true} \\
%		0 & \text{if } x \text{ is false}
%	\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%In other words, $1_x$ equals 1 when x is true and equals 0 when x is false, making it a convenient way to express the truth value of the variable x in mathematical notation.\\
Crucially, for the abovementioned constraint to work, the vehicles can not perform the aforementioned actions, i.e. waiting, routing and rebalancing, at the same time. Furthermore, the vehicles can not perform actions on multiple stations or roads. Therefore, the following constraint is necessary. \\
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}}(f^a_{i}(t+1)+\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}}v^a_{ij}(t) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}}w^a_{ij}(t)) = 1\label{eq:no_3_actions}
\end{equation}
This also implies that, if a vehicle is stationed at a station $i$, it can not have a position anywhere else. 
\begin{equation}
	%0<\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}}(f^a_{i}(t)+\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}}\dfrac{x^a_{ij}(t)}{d_{ij}}) \leq1 \label{eq:position_station}
	%d_{ji}
	\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}}(f^a_{i}(t)+1_{ x^a_{ji}(t)\neq 0}) =1 \label{eq:position_station}
\end{equation}
In other words, if I vehicle is travelling through an edge $\langle ji\rangle$, it can only be stationed at $i$ if it finished travelling. \\
While it is on the one hand interesting to know which station is currently hosting which vehicle, it is more important to know the amount of vehicles currently circulating in the system. This can be achieved by flipping the idea and therefore calculating how many vehicles out of the total number is currently not stationed. 
\begin{equation}
	F(t) = |\mathcal{A}| - \sum_{i \in\mathcal{N}}\sum_{a \in\mathcal{A}}f^a_{i}
\end{equation}


Denoted by $p_{ij}(t)$ and $g_{ij}(t)$ are the transportation and goods delivery requests respectively starting from station $i$ and headed to $j$. Let $o^p_{ij}(t)$ and $o^g_{ij}(t)$ denoting the number of outstanding requests from $i$ to $j$ for people or goods, respectively, one can describe its propagation as follows:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		o^p_{ij}(t+1) =& o^p_{ij}(t) + p_{ij}(t) - \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} P_a\cdot v^a_{ij}(t)\\
			o^g_{ij}(t+1) =& o^g_{ij}(t) + g_{ij}(t) - \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} G_a \cdot v^a_{ij}(t)\\
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:demand_time}
\end{equation}
%Furthermore, when a vehicle leaves, it can only leave 
It follows then that vehicles can not transport more than what requested, i.e.:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  P_a\cdot v^a_{ij}(t) &\leq o^p_{ij}(t) + p_{ij}(t) \\
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} G_a \cdot v^a_{ij}(t) &\leq o^g_{ij}(t) + g_{ij}(t)
	\end{aligned}
	 \label{eq:no_more_than_request}
\end{equation}


At this point, the definition of the control and the state of the system is complete. More specifically, the state of the system is described by the number outstanding requests $o_{ij}(t)$, the position of each moving vehicle $x_{ij}(t)$ and the position of each idle vehicle $f^a_{i}(t)$. Let the vector x(t) be the column vector column vector created by reshaping and concatenating $o_{ij}(t)$, $x_{ij}(t)$, $T_{ij}^a(t)$ and $f^a_{i}(t)$, the set of feasible states $\mathcal{X}$ is defined as follows. 

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\mathcal{X} &:= \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		&  o^p_{ij} \in (\mathbb{N}_0)^{|\mathcal{N}|}, o^g_{ij} \in (\mathbb{N}_0)^{|\mathcal{N}|},  \\
		 x \quad  \Bigg| \quad&g^a_{ij}, p^a_{ij},f^a_{i} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{N}|} \\%, \text{(\ref{eq:departed_variable})}, \text{(\ref{eq:arrived_variable})}, \text{(\ref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind})} \\
		&  x_{ij}^a\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{N}|}, V_{ij} \in \{ a \in \mathbb{N}_0 : a \leq |\mathcal{A}| \}^{|\mathcal{N}|}\\%T^a_{ij} \in [0, \dfrac{d_{ij}}{\epsilon}]^{|\mathcal{V}|}%T^a_{ij} \in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{V}|} \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}\\
	&\\
	&\text{where }  x = [o^p_{ij},o^g_{ij}, x_{ij}^a, f^a_{i}, V_{ij} , g^a_{ij}, p^a_{ij}]^T
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Note that $o^p_{ii} = 0$ and $o^p_{ii} = 0$. \\
%Note that because of   \equaref{eq:prop_w} \equaref{eq:prop_w}, the set of feasible states is time-dependent. 
Similarly, considering the control inputs $v^{a}_{ij}(t)$ and $w^{a}_{ij}(t)$, one can derive the set of feasible control set $\mathcal{U}(t)$ as follows. 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{\mathcal{U}}(t) := \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		&v^a_{ij} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{N}|}, v^a_{ii} = 0 \\
		u = [v^{a}_{ij}, w^{a}_{ij}]^T \Bigg|&w^a_{ij} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{N}|},w^a_{ii} = 0 \\ 
		&\text{(\ref{eq:prop_w})},\text{(\ref{eq:prop_v})}, \text{(\ref{eq:no_3_actions}),(\ref{eq:no_more_than_request})
		} \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}
\end{equation}
Since (\ref{eq:prop_w}) and (\ref{eq:prop_v}) depend on time, $\mathcal{U}(t)$ is also time-dependent. \\
Thanks to these formulations, the system can be written as a linear time-dependent system of the form
\begin{equation}
	x(t+1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\label{eq:normal_system}
\end{equation}
where $x(t) \in \mathcal{X}$, $u(t) \in \mathcal{U}(t)$ and $A$ and $B$ are the matrix associated to the coefficients of (\ref{eq:position_propagation}), (\ref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}) and (\ref{eq:demand_time}). \\
\subsection{Objectives}
Clearly, the main objective is to serve all the outstanding requests. 
\begin{equation}
	J_1(x(t)) = \sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{V}}(o^p_{ij}(t) + o^g_{ij}(t))\label{eq:no_request_left}
\end{equation}
However, the performance of the system can be optimized if other aspects are considered as well.  \\
Since the speed of the vehicles, according to the model, is determined by the number of vehicles on the street, limiting it will improve performance. Vehicles serving requests are responsible for the main objective and their number is directly proportional to the number of outstanding requests. On the other hand, rebalancing vehicles, while help reducing the  number of requests, they also contribute to congestions. Therefore, by reducing the number of free vehicles, the speed of the transporting ones is optimized as a result. 
\begin{equation}
	J_2(x(t)) = \sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{V}}w^a_{ij}(t) %T_{ij}^a
\end{equation}
Therefore, the final stage cost will be a combination of the two described above. 
\begin{equation}
	I(x(t)) = J_1(x(t)) + \lambda \cdot J_2(x(t)) 
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the weight used to determine the influence the rebalancing must have in the system.
\subsection{Model Evaluation}
Some comments are in order. Requests are treated considering customers and goods as single entities. More specifically, if a group consisting of three customers reach a station, this is treated as three individual requests, therefore $p_{ij}(t) = 3$. While this simplifies the model description and reflects the requirements for goods delivery, it would create an inconvenient scenario for traveling customers. As a matter of fact, it is not hard to envision situations where a group of travelers would like to travel together. However, it is out of the scope of this work to treat this scenario. One might also argue that this simplification effectively treats the model as if vehicles where single-occupancy and it is true in terms of intuition, this addition allows to reduce the number of variables by a constant factor, i.e. the sum of all vehicles' capacity. \\
The system described in \equaref{eq:normal_system} implicitely assumes the customer arrival to be known a priori. In order words, this is not treated as noise, but rather as a known quantity. 
\begin{equation}
	x(t+1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) + w(t)\label{eq:disturbed_mpc_formulation}
\end{equation}
where $x(t) \in \mathcal{X}$, $u(t) \in \mathcal{U}(t)$, $w(t) = [p_{ij}(t)\quad g_{ij}(t)\quad0\quad0 \quad0]^T$ and $A$ and $B$ are the matrix associated to the coefficients of (\ref{eq:position_propagation}), (\ref{eq:station_propagation}) and (\ref{eq:demand_time}). \\
\equaref{eq:disturbed_mpc_formulation} treats customer arrival as noise, or disturbance, which makes reasoning on the system considerably harder. Several techniques (\cite{Campo1987RobustMP}, \cite{LANGSON2004125}) have been proposed to deal with this type of MPC systems, i.e. Robust MPC.  Alternatively, some work propose solutions to estimate this quantity using Deep Learning techniques (\cite{9202791}, \cite{8569427}).
However, the analysis of those techniques and their performance in this scenario is out of the scope of this work.
Similarly to \secref{sec:vc_model}, the model must take into account that stations do not have unlimited amoun t of parking spots. As a consequence, the number of vehicles stationed must be limited accordingly and this is achieved as follows. 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}f^a_i(t) \leq C_i
	\label{eq:parking_limit}
\end{equation}
where $C_i$ indicates the number of parking spots available at $i$. \\
Furthermore, \equaref{eq:model_bpr_approximation2} imposes an implicit capacity limit on the streets. If $\epsilon=0$ and the limit $V^{max}_{ij}$ was exceeded, than the speed would also be zero. In this condition, the time would not be within the defined bounds, i.e. a constraint is violated. \\
Furthermore, one can also calculate the required time $T_{ij}(t)$ based on the speed approximation, as shown in \equaref{eq:required_time}. 
\begin{equation}
	T_{ij}^a(t) = \begin{cases}
			\dfrac{d_{ij} - x^a_{ij}(t)}{s_{ij}(V_{ij}(t))} &\quad \text{if } x_{ij}^a(t) \in (0,d_{ij})\\
			&\\
			0 &\quad\text{otherwise }
		\end{cases}
	\label{eq:required_time} 
\end{equation}
Since this function fails to satisfy the properties of homogeneity and additivity, it is not linear. Consequently,incorporating this function in the model will result in a non-linear model as well. Therefore, it has been decided to exclude it from the final version

\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:prob_formulat_mpc}
The MPC for the ATS problem is formulated as follows. \\
Given $x(t) \in \mathcal{X}$, determine the controls $u(t), \dots, u(t+N)$ according to the following optimization problem.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\underset{\substack{u(t), \dots, u(t+N)}}{\text{\textbf{min}}} \quad & J_f(x(N))+\sum_{t=0}^{N-1}I(x(t)) \\
		\text{\textbf{s.t.}} \quad & x(t+1) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)  \\
		& x(t) \in \mathcal{X}, \ u(t)\in \mathcal{U} \\
		%& k = t, \dots, t+N\\
		&x(N) \in \mathcal{X}_f\\
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:mpc_ats}
\end{equation}
where $J_f(x(t+N))$ is the terminal cost function and $\mathcal{X}_f$ is the terminal set. \\
As the main goal is to prove the stability of (\ref{eq:mpc_ats}), a proper definition of those will facilitate this objective. The strategy used to prove stability is the one described in \secref{sec:stable_mpc_systems}. For this purpose, the terminal set is required to be defined around an equilibrium point $x_*$. A good canidate for the equilibrium point in such systems can be found by observing that the system remains at a equilibrium whenever no more requests arrive and the are no more outstanding requests within the system. In other words, when 
\begin{align*}
	p_{ij}(t) &=0 \\
	g_{ij}(t) &=0\quad\quad \forall i,j\in\mathcal{V}\\
	o^p_{ij}(t) &=0\\
	o^g_{ij}(t) &=0\\
\end{align*}
By \equaref{eq:demand_time}, this implies that, eventually, no more vehicles will transport goods or people anymore. Furthermore, one can also conclude that vehicles will also stop rebalancing themselves. Therefore, $o_{ij}, x_{ij}^a$ and $V_{ij}$ all assume value zero. However, there is no way of knowing exactly where vehicles are going to be stationed. Upon inspection, however, one can canclude that vehicles must be stationed somewhere, since they are not driving. In other words, $f^a_{i}$ could assume any value in $\{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|} $ except $ \{0\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$. Furthermore, at equilibrium, all the vehicles are stationed. That means, the set of possible values for  $f^a_{i}$ is further limited accordingly. To define this set, let's consider a function $n : \mathcal{D}_{f^a_{i}} \rightarrow N$, where $\mathcal{D}'_{f^a_{i}}  = \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|} \setminus \{0\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$, which sums the number of 1s in the set. With this addition, one can fully define the set of values of $f^a_{i}$  at equilibrium. 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{f^a_{i}} := 	\left\{
	x   \quad | \quad x \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|},  n(x) = |\mathcal{A}|
	\right\}\label{eq:set_of_fs}
\end{equation}
%($\binom{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}{|\mathcal{A}|}$)
While the set is indeed smaller, it is still quite hard to exactly pin-point a specific equilibrium point, as already mentioned above. The difficulty arises because, out of all the elements in (\ref{eq:set_of_fs}), one can not directly identify the one which describes the system fully without knowing how the system progressed in time. However, one can conclude that the equilibrium points are all elements of the set described in \equaref{eq:final_eq}. 
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{E} := \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		& o^p_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|} , o^g_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|}  \\
		e = [o^p_{ij},o^g_{ij}, x_{ij}^a, f^a_{i}, V_{ij}]^T \Bigg| &g^a_{ij}, p^a_{ij}\in \{0\}, f^a_{i} \in \mathcal{D}_{f^a_{i}}   \\
		&  x_{ij}^a\in\{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|}, V_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}|} \\%, T^a_{ij}\in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{V}||\mathcal{A}|} \\
		%&  x_{ij}^a\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}, T^a_{ij} \in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{V}|} \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}\label{eq:final_eq}
\end{equation}\\
While this could be considered as a candidate for the terminal set $\mathcal{X}_f$, it turns out to be too restrictive. This is due to the fact that it would require all vehicles to be stationed and, therefore, not moving. Some of the conditions, however, can be relaxed by considering some implicit assumptions made during the development of the model. Mainly, vehicles are assumed to be perfect and to never break, therefore, one can consider a request to be satisfied the moment it has been picked up. As a result, while the number of requests is still zero, the conditions for $x_{ij}^a$, $f_{i}^a$, $g^a_{ij}$ and $V_{ij}$ can be relaxed. Furthermore, (\ref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}) is slighly changed so that vehicles do not leave the station as they arrive. This is achived by simply setting  $\sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}}(p^a_{ji}(N-1))=0$.
\begin{equation}
	f^a_i(N) =f^a_i(N-1) + \sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}}(g^a_{ji}(N-1)) 
	\label{eq:stationed_propagation_ind2}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
	\mathcal{X}_f &:= \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		& o^p_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|} , o^g_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|}  \\
		x_f \quad \Bigg| \quad &g^a_{ij},f^a_{i} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|},  p^a_{ij}\in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{N}||\mathcal{A}|}\\%\text{(\ref{eq:departed_variable})}, \text{(\ref{eq:arrived_variable})}, \text{(\ref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind2})}   \\
		%&  x_{ij}^a\in\{0\}^{|\mathcal{V}||\mathcal{A}|} , T^a_{ij}\in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{V}||\mathcal{A}|} \\
		&  x_{ij}^a\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{N}|}, V_{ij} \in \{ a \in \mathbb{N}_0: a \leq |\mathcal{A}| \}^{|\mathcal{N}|}\\% T^a_{ij} \in [0, \dfrac{d_{ij}}{\epsilon}]^{|\mathcal{V}|}%T^a_{ij} \in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{V}|} \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}\\
	&\\
	&\text{where }  x_f = [o^p_{ij},o^g_{ij}, x_{ij}^a, f^a_{i}, V_{ij} , g^a_{ij}, p^a_{ij}]^T
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:final_x_f}
\end{equation}\\
By construction, therefore, $\mathcal{E} \subset \mathcal{X}_f \subset \mathcal{X}$. \\
In addition, thanks to this definition, another desiderable conditions apply. Since $ x_{ij}^a\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$ and $V_{ij} \in \{ a \in \mathbb{N}_0 : a \leq |\mathcal{A}| \}^{|\mathcal{N}|}$, empty vehicles can also be navigating, which allows rebalancing, too. Moreover, since vehicles are not required to be stationed and the minimum requirement for a request to be satisfied is to be picked up, as long as the capacity of the vehicle stationed in $i$ is enough to cover the request, than the number of outstanding requests is still zero. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  P_a\cdot f^a_{i}(t) &\ge p_{ij}(t) \\
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} G_a \cdot f^a_{i}(t) &\ge  g_{ij}(t) \quad\quad \forall i,j\in\mathcal{V}\\
	o^p_{ij}(t) &=0\\
	o^g_{ij}(t) &=0\\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:conserved_rela}
\end{equation}
This further relaxation also allows to better reason about the control law $\kappa_f$ required to prove stability of the controller. The two main requirements are (i) $\kappa_f \in \mathcal{U}$ and (ii) the set $\mathcal{X}_f$ remains feasible, since they are among the main assumption for the controller stability (\secref{sec:stable_mpc_systems}). Furthermore, 
at each time, it is required that the capacity of the vehicle leaving a station is equal to the new demand, as the number of outstanding requests is zero. 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  P_a\cdot v^a_{ij}(t) &=   o^p_{ij}(t) \\
		\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} G_a \cdot v^a_{ij}(t) &=   o^g_{ij}(t)
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq:no_more_than_request_f}
\end{equation}
Vehicles, however, can only leave a station if they are present at that station. On the same note, since there must be enough vehicles at every station to serve the requests, those must be rebalanced in such a way that, once a request arrives, a vehicle is ready to serve it. \\
The control law that must be designed can be seen as a function mapping $\mathcal{X}_f$ to a subset of $\mathcal{U}$, i.e. $\kappa_f:\mathcal{X}_f \rightarrow\mathcal{U}_{\kappa_f} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$. This function must express then need to ''conserve'' the relation in \equaref{eq:conserved_rela}, which has the by product of also satisfying \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request}.\\
 Furthermore, as a vehicle leaves a station, another vehicle must take its place. Therefore, the follow relation must also hold. 
 \begin{equation}
 	\begin{aligned}
 		P_a\cdot v^a_{ij} &\leq \sum_{j \in\mathcal{V}} \sum_{a'\in \mathcal{A} \setminus \{a\}}P_{a'}\cdot	w^{a'}_{ji}\\
 		G_a\cdot v^a_{ij} &\leq \sum_{j \in\mathcal{V}} \sum_{a'\in \mathcal{A} \setminus \{a\}}G_{a'}\cdot w^{a'}_{ji}\\
 	\end{aligned}
 	\label{eq:replace_vehicle}
 \end{equation}
\equaref{eq:replace_vehicle} is used to ensure that, if a vehicle leaves a station, it must be replaced by one or more vehicles with at least the same capacity.
A remark is required. \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request_f} and \equaref{eq:replace_vehicle} indeed allow vehicles to be replaced and, therefore, potentially take care of the requests. However, in addition to the assumption made for \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request_f}, the state of the system will remain in $\mathcal{X}_f$ only as long as the requests are made within a time interval corresponding to the time required to travel  from the furthest station to the starting station. In other words, this is a very particular case of extrogenous requests. Therefore, for the rest of this section, the external arriving requests will be considered as zero, i.e. $o^p_{ij}(t) =  o^g_{ij}(t) = 0$, therefore treating the system as undisturbed. This also allows to determine a simpler subset for the control law. Considering all the requests are served, then no more transporting vehicles $v^a_{ij}$ should leave stations and, likewise, since no more requests are going to arrive, then the number of new rebalancing vehicles $w^a_{ij}$ should also be zero
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{\mathcal{U}}_{\kappa_f}(t) := \left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		&v^a_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|} \\
		u = [v^{a}_{ij}, w^{a}_{ij}]^T \Bigg|&w^a_{ij} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}\\ 
		&\text{(\ref{eq:prop_w})},\text{(\ref{eq:prop_v})}, \text{(\ref{eq:no_3_actions}),(\ref{eq:no_more_than_request})
		} \\
	\end{aligned}
	\right\}
\end{equation}
It is trivial to demonstrate that $\mathcal{\mathcal{U}}_{\kappa_f}(t) \subseteq \mathcal{U}$. By construction \equaref{eq:no_3_actions} and \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request} are satisfied. \\
This assumption also allows to derive an appropriate cost function for the system. As indicated in \secref{sec:stable_mpc_systems}, the candidate terminal cost must be a Lyapunov function (see \secref{sec:general_definitions} for more details).  \\
While it is usually difficult to construct an appropriate Lyapunov function, since the system considered is undisturbed, one can construct a function satisfying the Lyapunov properties by starting from the vehicles in motion during the system. Within the decisions made, one candidate for the terminal cost function can be found by observing the vehicles that are still driving around the system. Since the system is undisturbed and the requests are all taken care of, three candidate can be determinded. Firstly, if the traveling time $T_{ij}^a$ has been included in the model, this can be used to determine a cost function $J_t(x)$ which can be proved to be Lyapunov\footnote{The definition and proof can be found in \secref{appendix:sec:lyapunovitity_time} }. Alternatively, an immidiate candidate is the number of vehicles stll moving in the system. The terminal cost function $J_v(x) : \mathcal{X}_f \rightarrow R_+$ is trivial to define. \\
\begin{equation}
	 J_v(x(N)):= \sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{V}}V_{ij}\label{eq:cost_function_v}
\end{equation}
With these assumptions proving $J_v(x)$ to be Lyapunov is straight forward. \\

\begin{proposition}{}
	Within the definition of $\mathcal{X}_f$, (\ref{eq:cost_function_v}) is a Lyapunov Function in $\mathcal{X}_f$
\end{proposition}\\
\textit{Proof. } Considering an equilibrium point $x_{\mathcal{E}}\in\mathcal{E}$, three conditions must be met.\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The function must be strictly positive except at $x_{\mathcal{E}}$, i.e.
	\begin{equation*}
		\sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{V}}V_{ij}(t) >0
	\end{equation*}
	This is indeed satisfied by definition of $\mathcal{X}_f$. More specifically, when the system is not at $x_{\mathcal{E}}$, then there are vehicles stll moving, hence $\sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{N}}V_{ij} >0$. \\
	\item Secondly, the function must assume the value of zero at equilibrium. ln other words, given the point $x_{\mathcal{E}}$
	\begin{equation*}
		J_v(x_{\mathcal{E}}) = 0
	\end{equation*}
	At equilibrium, there are no vehicles moving. Clearly, the terminal cost function is zero. 
	\item $J_v$ must decrease $\forall x \in \mathcal{X}_f$. 
	\begin{equation*}
		J_v(x(k+1)) - J_v(x(k))\leq 0
	\end{equation*}
	Let's consider a sytem with only one vehicle $a$ still moving. If the vehicle is not rebalancing or transporting a customer, it can be considered at equilibrium, hence $\sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{N}}V_{ij} =0$ . $J_v$ does not increase nor decrease with time, hence the condition is satisfied. \\
	If the vehicle is moving, since it can not move backwards, as time increases, by propagation of $x_{ij}^a$, its position always increases until $x_{ij}^a \ge d_{ij}$. During this time window, $\sum_{i,j \in \mathcal{N}}V_{ij} =1$, eventually reaching the station $j$ and therefore not being in motion anymore, hence the condition remains satisfied. For a system composed of more vehicles, regardless of whether on the same link or not, the same discussion applies. More specifically, since the number of moving vehicles can not increase, can only decrease or remaining the same, hence the condition remains satisfied.
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Proof of Stability}

For the rest of this section, the notation will be eased as follows. 
\begin{align*}
	x &= x(t)\\
	u &= u(t)\\
	x^+ &= x(t+1)
\end{align*} In order to prove stability of (\ref{eq:mpc_ats}), it is imperative to first demonstrate the feasibility of the state sets $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{X}_f$\footnote{\secref{appendix:feasibility_x_xf_time} contains the same proof for the sets containing time. The proof in this section works in with those definitions as well} .\\


\begin{proposition}{(Feasibility of $\mathcal{X}$)}\label{pro:feas_x}
	Let $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and $u \in \mathcal{U}(t)$, then $x_+ \in \mathcal{X}$
\end{proposition}\\

\textit{Proof}. Let $x^+ = [o_{ij}^{p+}, o_{ij}^{g+}, x_{ij}^{a+}, f^{a+}_{i}, V_{ij}^{+}, g^{a+}_{ij}, p^{a+}_{ij}]^T$ and $u = [v^{a}_{ij}, w^{a}_{ij}]^T$. Since $u \in \mathcal{U}$, then \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request} is satisfied, hence $o_{ij}^{p+}, o_{ij}^{g+} \in (\mathbb{N}_0)^{|\mathcal{V}|}$. Trivially, by construction $V_{ij}^{+}$ is also $\in \mathcal{X}$. Likewise, $g^{a+}_{ij}, p^{a+}_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$ because of (\ref{eq:arrived_variable}) and (\ref{eq:departed_variable}). \\
The condition $f^{a+}_{i} \in \{0,1\}^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$ can be proven with the help of \equaref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}. At first vehicles are either present at a station $i$ or not. If vehicles are not stationed, then no action can be taken due to \equaref{eq:no_3_actions} (if $u \in \mathcal{U}$, then it is satisfied), which impliese no vehicle is departing or arriving at the station. Otherwise, if vehicles are indeed stationed, then $f^{a}_{i} = 1$. If a vehicle moves, i.e. if $w^a_{ij}(t) = 1$ or $v^a_{ij}(t) = 1$, because of the first condition of \equaref{eq:position_propagation}, then because of \equaref{eq:departed_variable} and (\ref{eq:arrived_variable}) being mutually exclusive, at the next step $f^{a+}_{i} =0$. If, on the other hand, the vehicle is approaching the station, i.e. $f^{a}_{i} =0$ and 
either $v^a_{ji}(t) = 1$ or $w^a_{ji}(t) = 1$, then the following enfolds. If $x_{ij}^{a} \leq d_ij$, $f^{a+}_{i} =0$. Assuming $x_{ij}^{a} \ge d_{ij}$, then $g^{a+}_{ij} = 1$, due to \equaref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}, then either $f^{a+}_{i} =1$ if  $v^a_{ji}(t) = w^a_{ji}(t) = 0$, or $f^{a+}_{i} =0$, if $v^a_{ji}(t) = 1$ or $w^a_{ji}(t) = 1$, which would imply $p^{a+}_{ij}=1$. \\
 $x_{ij}^{a+}\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$ is proved by observing $x_{ij}^a$ in  \equaref{eq:position_propagation}. In case $v^a_{ij}(t) + w^a_{ij}(t)= 0$, the condition is satisfied, since  $x_{ij}^{a+} = 0$.  On the other hand, in case of $v^a_{ij}(t) + w^a_{ij}(t)= 1$, the condition is satisfied by definition of $s_{ij}$ and $V_{ij}(t)$. \\

\begin{proposition}{(Feasibility of $\mathcal{X}_f$)}\label{pro:feas_xf}
	Let $x \in \mathcal{X}_f$ and $\kappa_f(x) \in \mathcal{U}_{\kappa_f}(t)$, then $x_+\in \mathcal{X}_f$
\end{proposition}\\

\textit{Proof}. Let $x^+ = [o_{ij}^{p+}, o_{ij}^{g+}, x_{ij}^{a+}, f^{a+}_{i}, V_{ij}^{+}, g^{a+}_{ij}, p^{a+}_{ij}]^T$ and $\kappa_f(x) = [v^{a}_{ij}, w^{a}_{ij}]^T$. Since the system is treated as undisturbed, $o_{ij}^{p+}= o_{ij}^{g+},=0$. Because $\kappa_f(x) \in \mathcal{U}_{\kappa_f}(t)$, then \equaref{eq:no_more_than_request_f} is satisfied, implying there is no vehicle leaving the station to serve a request. By construction $V_{ij}^{+}$ is also $\in \mathcal{X}_f$. Likewise, $g^{a+}_{ij}\in \{0,1\}$ because of (\ref{eq:arrived_variable}). \\
If $w^a_{ij} = 0$ , then nothing happens within the system, therefore all the vehicles remain at the station, then $ f^{a+}_{i} \in \{0\}^{|\mathcal{V}||\mathcal{A}|}$ $\forall i \in \mathcal{V}$. Consequently   $x_{ij}^{a+} = 0$, i.e.  $\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$.\\
If vehicles are in movement, i.e. $w^a_{ij} = 1$, a similar argument to the one proposed for the feasibility of $\mathcal{X}$ can be made. Because of \equaref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind}, $f^{a+}_{i}=0$ and $x_{ij}^{a+}\in (\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0})^{|\mathcal{A}||\mathcal{V}|}$, by definition of $s_{ij}$ and $V_{ij}(t)$. Eventually, as the vehicle approaches the station, $d_{ji} = x^a_{ji}(t)$, then $f^{a+}_{i}=1$ due to \equaref{eq:stationed_propagation_ind} and $p^{a+}_{ij}=0$. Since 
\equaref{eq:no_3_actions} is respected ($\kappa_f(x) \in \mathcal{U}_{\kappa_f}(t)$), then  (\ref{eq:position_station}) is also respected, as $ w^{a+}_{ij}=0 \implies x_{ij}^{a+}=0$. Condition (\ref{eq:replace_vehicle}) is always respected, assuming there is no new requests. \\



\subsection*{Controller stability}


\begin{proposition}{(Stability of \ref{eq:mpc_ats})}\\

	Given $\mathcal{X}_f$and $J_f$ defined in (\ref{eq:final_x_f}) and (\ref{eq:cost_function_v}), respectively, and let $\kappa_f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}_{\kappa_f}$,  then the controller defined in (\ref{eq:mpc_ats}) is stable in the sense of Lyapunov.
\end{proposition}\\

\textit{Proof.} To prove stability, one must (1) prove the recursive feasibility of $\mathcal{X}_f$ and (2) that the optimal cost function $J*$ is Lyapunov .
\begin{enumerate}
	\item As stated by Proposition \ref{pro:feas_x}, $\mathcal{X}$ is feasible. Let $x\in \mathcal{X}$ and $[u^*_0, u^*_1, \dots, u^*_{N-1}]$ be an optimal control sequence calculated at $x$. At $x^+$ the control sequence $[u^*_0, u^*_1, \dots, \kappa_f(x^*_N)]$ is feasible. This is because $x_N\in \mathcal{X}_f$ and, therefore, $x_+=Ax^*+B\kappa_f(x^*_N) \in \mathcal{X}_f$, since $\mathcal{X}_f$ is feasible, as proven in Proposition \ref{pro:feas_xf}.\\
	This proves recursive feasibility.
	\item Given the optimal cost function
	\begin{equation*}
	J^*(k) = J_f(x^*_N)+\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}I(x^*_i, u^*_i)
	\end{equation*}
	At $x(k+1) = x^*_1$, the following needs to be shown
	\begin{equation*}
		J^*(k+1) \leq \widetilde{J}(k)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\widetilde{J}(k)$ is the candidate function and calculated at $\widetilde{U} = \{u^*_1, u^*_2, \dots, \kappa_f(x^*_N)\}$. Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		J^*(k+1) \leq& \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}I(x^*_i, u^*_i) + I(x^*_N, \kappa_f(x^*_N)) + J_f(Ax^*_N + B \kappa_f(x^*_N))\\
		J^*(k+1) \leq& \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}I(x^*_i, u^*_i) +I(x^*_0, u^*_0)-I(x^*_0, u^*_0) + J(x^*_N, \kappa_f(x^*_N)) + J_f(Ax^*_N + B \kappa_f(x^*_N))\\
		J^*(k+1) \leq& \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}I(x^*_i, u^*_i) -I(x^*_0, u^*_0) + I(x^*_N, \kappa_f(x^*_N)) + J_f(Ax^*_N + B \kappa_f(x^*_N))\\
		\text{Since }&J^*(k) = J_f(x^*_N)+\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}I(x^*_i, u^*_i)\\
		J^*(k+1) \leq& J^*(k)  -I(x(k), u^*_0)+  \underset{\leq 0 \text{ because $J_f$ is a Lyapunov function}}{\underbrace{J_f(Ax^*_N + B \kappa_f(x^*_N)) + I(x^*_N, \kappa_f(x^*_N)) - J_f(x^*_N)}}\\
		\implies& J^*(k+1) - J^*(k) \leq -I(x(k), u^*_0) \quad I(x,u) >0 \text{ for }x,u \neq 0
	\end{align*}
	As a result, the optimal cost is a Lyapunov function. Hence, the system is asymptotically stable. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use Case Analysis}\label{sec:use_case_mpc}
The use case has been developed using the same data \secref{sec:use_case_analysis_ats} with three main goals in mind. First, the theoratical hinsights about the stability of the controller need to be confermed. The hypothesis is that, if the model has full knoweledge of the future requests, as long as every request is satisfies, then a control law should be found such that minimizes the cost function defined in \equaref{eq:no_request_left}. Secondly, while the stability of the undesturbed controller is necessary, a real world application will likely deal with a noisy system, which, in this context, translates in extrogenous requests which are not considered in advanced. In this case, the hypothesis is that the controller, albeit with a longer horizon, is still able to minimize \equaref{eq:no_request_left}. Finally, the model's performance needs to be evaluated using real-world data to determine if it's feasible for application. A summary of the parameters for the simulation can be found in \tabref{tab:mpc_simu}.
