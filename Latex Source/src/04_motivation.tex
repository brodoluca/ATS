\chapter{Motivation}
The economic impact of congestion in the United States is substantial, amounting to approximately \$121 billion per year or 1\% of the country's GDP (\cite{schrank2012}). This figure encompasses not only the staggering 5.5 billion hours lost to traffic congestion but also an additional 2.9 billion gallons of fuel burned. Moreover, these estimates overlook the potential costs associated with negative externalities such as vehicular emissions (including greenhouse gases and particulate matter) (\cite{pant2013}), travel-time uncertainty (\cite{carrion2012}), and an elevated risk of accidents (\cite{hennessy1999}).
