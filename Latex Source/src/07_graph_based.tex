\chapter{Time-Invariant Model of AToD}
This chapter focuses on tackling dispatching, routing and rebalancing problems for an AToD system. First, a time-invariant vehicle-centric model for the transportation network is developed in \secref{sec:vc_model}. The model presented in this document expands upon the one formulated in \cite{project_thesis}, using graph theory and a vehicle-centric approach to provide flexibility in handling different vehicle capacities and types. Additionally, this model addresses the combination of mobility of people with goods transportation, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of transportation networks. This model be the basis for the analysis and formulation of the aformentioned problems in \secref{sec:prob_form}. 
\section{Vehicle-centric Model}\label{sec:vc_model}
The model provided in this section will expand the model formulated in \cite{project_thesis}. It is worth noting that, although the model presented in \cite{project_thesis} is specific for the scenario described in previous sections of the same work, it can be expanded to cover more general use cases. \\
It follows that the transportation network will be modeled using graph theory. Most of the literature makes use of (Eulerian) fluid-dynamic models (\cite{amod_review}), i.e. customers and AVs are represented as (non-integer) flow between nodes, in this work,
this model will be used in addition to a vehicle-centric approach, where customers and AVs will be modeled individually. Contrary to the solutions proposed by most of the literature, this work combines mobility of people with goods transportation, therefore modeling vehicles individually will provided the required flexibility to handle different capacities and the increased complexity given by the plethora and variety of vehicles, as we will see later in this section. The set of vehicles will be refered to as $\mathcal{A}$. \\ 
Let $\mathcal{G} = \langle \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E} \rangle$ being the directed graph representing corresponding transportation network of the  city in question, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of vertices and $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}$ is the set of edges. Any vertex, or node,  $ v \in  \mathcal{V}$ represents a location. Following the notation in \cite{project_thesis}, each node consists of an area of interests. For the context of this paper, the two terms will be used intercheangeably, as they ultimately indicate the same thing. An edge $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle \in \mathcal{E}$ represents a connection, which can consist of a road or a combination of those, linking $v_i$ to $v_j$. The level of abstraction is decided by the engineer and can be used to regulate the granularity of the model. Locations $v_i$ and $v_j$ can indicate low level key points, such as cross roads or trafficated traffic lights, as well as higher level areas such as residental areas or leisure centers. Similarly, an edge can contain multiple crossroads or joints or simply indicating a path from $v_i$ to $v_j$, regardless of additional details. A correct granularity is not trivial to decide a priori and a general approach is likewise hard to delineate.  Determining the level of abstraction remains, therefore, an engineer's prerogative and highly depends on the system in question. It is also worth noting that the, for conveniency and to better reflect the situation in real world applications, the graph is not a bidirect graph. To model a two-way road, one should simply make use of two edges from locations $v_i$ and $v_j$. \\
As also described in \cite{project_thesis}, each edge is associated with multiple metrics and information. \\
Firstly, at each edge one must attribute a travel time $T$. $T$ is a function $T: \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$, which at each given a vehicle and edge maps a float value $T_{i,j}^a \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ indicating the time required for the  vehicle of type $a$ to travel the path from $v_i$ to $v_j$. In this work, the unit of  $T_{i.j}^a$ is of particular interest, as it depends on the application. \\
Secondly, each edge is also associated with a distance $d: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, which maps an edge to a float value $d_{i,j}$ indicating the distance from $v_i$ to $v_j$. \\
Another factor which is considered in this work, as stated above, is pollution. This metric is associated to each edge and is a function 
$f: \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. To simplify the discussion for this work, $f$ is assumed to produce a certain value refered to as pollution index. In other words, it is not supposed to represent a measurable element, such as $\text{CO}_2$ emissions, but rather a value which can represent multiple quantitative factors and is higher if the combination of path and vehicle type is highly polluting. While it can be argued that the pollution can also be simply a function of $d$ and $T$, this abstraction does not account for other elements, such as road type, vehicle fuel and road slope. The index $f$, therefore, is a mathematical abstraction which allows a more flexible model for the system. To use this abstraction, however, each edge must include additional information, including the one mentioned before. \\
Similarly to what observed by \citepaperofs{congestion_vrp_phd_graph}{Zhang}, we can introduce the concept of congestions in the model by constraining the routing by the capacity of each road. In other words, we can associate each edge with a capacity $c: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{> 0}$ indicating the limit in terms of car occupancy above which the traffic in that edge slows down eventually reaching a congestion. As pointed out in \cite{congestion_vrp_phd_graph}, this semplified model is adequate in this context as well as the aim of this work focusing solely on the control of vehicles to prevent congestion rather than analyzing their behavior in congested network. While it is understood that congestions behave differently in real world scenarios and other, more sophisticated approaches exist (\cite{lindsey1999congestion}, \cite{verhoef1999time}), for the sake of simplicity, we will assume $T_{ija} = \infty $ if the number of vehicles in that edge from  $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle$ to be larger than the capacity $c_{ij}$.\\
In addition, each edge $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle$ will also include information regarding traffic limitations, i.e. whether a vehicle type is allowed or not to travel that link. Intuitively, limitations will be represented as a function $s: \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$, where $1$ implies the vehicle can traver that edge. Following the example in \cite{project_thesis}, limitations can be because of various factors, like for e.g. weight or height. For this reason, it is convenient to abstract away such details and just indicate wether a link is can be traversed or not. Notably, one could use this representation to transform a bidirect graph $G'$ to be equivalent to $G$ by letting $s(e,a) = 0$ for any one-way road $e = \langle v_i, v_j \rangle$ for all $a \in \mathcal{A}$. For convenience, this function will be incorporated in the definition of the capacity, updating it to become \equaref{eq:capacity}. 
\begin{equation}
	c(e = \langle v_i, v_j \rangle) = 
	\begin{cases}
		0 & \text{if } s(e) = 0 \\
		c(e) & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\label{eq:capacity}
\end{equation}
Following the discussion above, this is equivalent to setting $T_{ija} = \infty$ for all $a \in \mathcal{A}$ according to this model specifications. In this way, we can treat the road as being unaccessible without increasing the number of conditions and decrease the redeability of the model. \\
As mentioned above, the set of autonomous vehicles is indicated as $\mathcal{A}$ and each vehicle will be modeled as a tuple $\langle \underline{s_a},\bar{t_a}, S_a, Q_a, I^b_a, R^-_a, R^+_a, \theta_a, B_a(t),\mathcal{R}_a, \mathcal{T}_a \rangle$. $\underline{s_a}\in \mathcal{V} \text{ and } \bar{t_a}\in \mathcal{V}$ are the starting and terminal node respectively; $Q_a \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ will be used to indicate battery capacity and charing rate and discharging rate will be represented as  $R^+_a \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}\text{ and } R^-_a\in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ respectively; $\theta_a \in [0,1]$ is used to model the battery breakpoint and $B_a(t)\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ is the state of charge at time $t$; $\mathcal{R}_a$ is the set of requests assigned to vehicle $a$ and $\mathcal{T}_a$ is the type. For a more detailed understanding of the vehicle type, the reader is encouraged to analyze the discussion in \cite{project_thesis}. For the purpose of this work, the vehicle type will be understood as a tuple $\langle P_a, G_a, C_a, F_a \rangle$, where , $G_a \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ and $P_a \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$
are the goods and people capacity and $C_a \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and $F_a \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ indicate operational cost and pollution factor respectively. Furthermore, each set of assigned requests $\mathcal{R}_a$ is a subset of the set of all requests in the systems, i.e. $\mathcal{R}_a \subseteq\mathcal{R}$. For the purpose of this model, we will assume each request assignment to be unique, i.e. $\mathcal{R}_a \neq \mathcal{R}_b \text{ and } \mathcal{R}_a \subseteq \mathcal{R} \setminus \mathcal{R}_b,  \text{ for all } (a,b) \in \mathcal{A} \text{ with } a\neq b$. \\
The battery will be modeled according to the two operating mode, i.e. charging and discharging. While it is understood that these two operations are highly influenced by multiple factors, it is sensible to make assumptions in order to simplify the model. 
As it is also widely spread in industry, one can neglet the influence of external factors such as weather condition or intrinsic characteristics of the battery, such as temperature or age. The charging profile will be modelled taking inspiration from the model proposed by \citepaperofs{lee2020model}{Lee}. As mentioned above, the vehicles have a charging rate, a battery capacity and a breakpoint, namely $R^+_a, Q_a \text{ and } \theta_a$ respectively. The state of charge at time $t \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ of a certain vehicle will be obtained according to the model described in \equaref{eq:cc_cv}, which is derived from the CC-CV (Constant current - Constant Voltage ) scheme. (A more complete explenation can be found in \cite{LIU2020101342}).%$B :\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \times \mathcal{A}  \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$

		Q_a - \dfrac{Q_ai(t)(1-\theta_a)}{R^+_a}
		\end{cases}
		\label{eq:cc_cv}
\end{equation}

with $b_a = \dfrac{\theta_a Q_a}{R^+_a}$,  $i(t)= \begin{cases} R^+_a \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
	R^+_a e^{-(t-b_a)/\tau}\\ \end{cases}$ and $\tau= \dfrac{C_n}{R^+_a\theta_a}\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$  representing how quickly the current decreases. The value of $C_n$ depends on the charging device considered.   \\
	An example of the charging profiles from this model can be seen in \figref{fig:charging_profiles}. 
	 Since $i(t)$ is assumed to be constant at time $t\leq b_a$, i.e. $i(t) = R^+_a$,the first condition is derived as follows. 
\begin{align*}
	B_a(t+\alpha) &= B_a(t) + \int_{t}^{t+\alpha}R^+_adt\\
	B_a(t+\alpha) &= B_a(t) +R^+_a \int_{t}^{t+\alpha}dt\\
	B_a(t+\alpha) &= B_a(t) +R^+_a \quad t \bigg|_{t}^{t+\alpha}\\
	B_a(t+\alpha) &= B_a(t) +R^+_a (t+\alpha - t)\\
	B_a(t+\alpha) &= B_a(t) +\alpha R^+_a\\
\end{align*}
with $\alpha = 1$. \\
The discharging, on the other hand, will be modeled as it being directly proportional to the travel time $T$, as described in \equaref{eq:discharging}. 
%\begin{equation}
%	B_a(t+1) = B(t)_a - R^-_a ( \gamma d_a + (1-\gamma)T_a)
%	\label{eq:discharging}
%\end{equation} 
%where $\gamma \in [0,1]$. \\
\begin{equation}
	B_a(t+T_{u,v}^a) = B(t)_a - R^-_a T_{u,v}^a
	\label{eq:discharging}
\end{equation} 
The equation describes the relationship between the initial and final battery levels on edge $\langle v_u, v_v \rangle$ during the transit. Following \equaref{eq:discharging}, one can assign to each edge a rate of battery discharge by defining it as the difference between the state of charge at time $t$ and at time $t+T_{u,v}^a$. \\
\begin{equation}
	 e^a_{u,v} = B(t)_a - B_a(t+T_{u,v}^a) =  R^-_a T_{u,v}^a
	\label{eq:discharging_rate_per_edge}
\end{equation} 
\equaref{eq:discharging_rate_per_edge} allows to describe the discharging rate as a function of only the edge and the vehicle. \\
In terms of operational costs, multiple factors should be considered and the analysis must be extended from the one developed in \cite{project_thesis}, where the operational cost was only in function of the vehicle type. Similarly to the aforementioned work, this model assumes a certain operational cost depending on the vehicle type, however the discussion is also extended in terms of vehicle charging cost. In other words, we can decouple it from the general concept of the operational cost per vehicle and considering in function of the charging or discharging profiles described above. Furthermore, it also makes sense to assign the cost also depending on the distance traveled, i.e. the value $d$ associated to the edges. \\
Compared to \cite{project_thesis}, in this work, the model also extends the information associated to the nodes. Nodes will be of two categories namely normal nodes and charging (or depot) stations, whose sets are denoted as $\mathcal{V}_n$, $\mathcal{V}_c$, respectively. We can, therefore, conclude that $\mathcal{V} = \mathcal{V}_n \cup \mathcal{V}_c$. The information associated to the nodes depend from the category each node belongs to. Nodes belonging to $\mathcal{V}_n$ do not possess any specific information, as they are not of high importance for this work. Charging nodes $\mathcal{V}_c$, on the other hand, possess two main characteristics, namely their capacity and their charging ability. Intuitively, the term capacity is used to refer to the number of avilable parking spots, identified as $z_v$. Furthermore, three types of charging ability will be considered, i.e. fast, normal and slow charging, which will be based on the model in \equaref{eq:cc_cv}. The choice of parameters is explained in \tabref{tab:charging_stations}.

\end{table}\\

It is a sensible choice to limit the domain of the starting and terminal node of each vehicle to the sets of charging and depot nodes, i.e. $\underline{s_a}\in\mathcal{V}_c \cup \mathcal{V}_d \text{ and } \bar{t_a}\in \mathcal{V}_c \cup \mathcal{V}_d$. In other words, this choice implies that each vehicle's destination will either be the depot at the end of the shift, for example, or a charging node, where its battery can be charged to accomodate future requests. \\
Requests are modeled as tuples $\langle \underline{s'},\bar{t'}, G', P',\lambda, a', b'\rangle$, where  $\underline{s'} \in \mathcal{V}_n,\bar{t'} \in \mathcal{V}_n$ represent the pickup and delivery point respectively; $G'\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ ($P'\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$) refers to the amount of goods (people) required to transport,  and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is the rate of requests, in customers per unit time, which, therefore, makes the requests stationary and deterministic. Additionally, requests must be delivered within a time window within $[a',b']$. \\



\subsection{Model Evalutation}
Some comments are in order. The model in \secref{sec:vc_model} is time-invariant. According to the definition presented by \citepaperofs{amod_review}{Frazzoli}, time invariance in the context of transportation modeling refers to the assumption that the number of requests remain constant over time allowing for the simplification of temporal dynamics and treating specific time intervals as homogeneous units. This modeling concept is employed when the rate of change in transportation demands is deemed slow compared to the average travel time of individual trips, often observed in stable urban environments (\cite{neuburger1971}). While this model is indeed applied in a relatively dense urban environment, some integrations are required in order to adapt it to time-varying scenarios. Moreover, customer requests are also assumed to be known. This requirement can be fulfilled in practice with requests made in advance or some techniques to estimate requests throughout the day. It is important to note that request estimation might lead to suboptimal performance. \\
Secondly, as already mentioned in the previous section, the model used to describe congestions is indeed rather simple and more complex formulation might better capture the phenomena. However, the semplification is considered powerful enough for the purpose of this work and, as pointed out by \citepaperofs{congestion_vrp_phd_graph}{Zhang} as well, more sophisticated models can be used offline using simulation techniques to derive the capacity metric used in this model.\\
Some comments are in order also regarding vehicles. Firstly, we assume the vehicles to be autonomous and fault proof. It is outside of the scope of this work to deal malfunctioning vehicles or exceptional situations outside of the normale functioning regime of the system.Additionally, we assume the vehicles to be fully electric. This assumption is widely used in literature and it is motivated, among other aspects, also by the recent trends in industry to transition towards electrical mobility. Furthermore, the model provided for the battery charging and discharging profiles is rather simplistics and more sophisticated approaches exist in literature (see \chapref{ch:related_work} for more details). However, these models should be seen an addition to the corrent approach and, albeit with some potential modifications, it is plausible they can be integrated in the system model. While in \cite{project_thesis} vehicles have been designed to be capable of transporting a potentially large number of people, some considerations should be made in this regard. While it is sensitive to consider vehicles capable of transporting up to 50 people in terms of environmental, economical and overall transportation efficiency and while it is also expected that the model designed would work with those vehicles as well, in terms of practical use, it might be more appropriate to make use of those vehicles in different ways. Notably, it should be studied whether it is efficient to tailor the routes of those vehicles according to passenger needs. Firstly, if we do not consider ride-sharing possibilities, the scenario of such large group of people traveling together is very unlikely. Additionally, if we consider ride-sharing, the possible route combinations, which increases drastically as the number of requests and nodes in the graph increase, would likely make routing such vehicle relatively inefficient. Motivated also by the fact that passengers might have common stops, it might be more sensible to treat those vehicles as buses are treated nowadays, i.e. with a pre-determined route among stops which are placed according to the most common stops, such as hospitals or train stations. Similarly, if we consider large vehicles to transport goods, such as large trucks, those are not used for home delivery, but rather used to transport goods among specialized centers. It must be noted that both situations do not invalidate this work, or any previous work. It is clear that the system described in this work in combination to the truck for goods transportation. Regarding people mobility, while buses are indeed an already established and efficient transportation mean, this systems aims at filling up the situations where a bus system is indeed lacking, such as transportation of people with special needs or, in general, more tailored to the specific needs of potential customers. \\
In this model, we also made certain assumptions on the nodes. Firstly, there is no distinction between depot and charging nodes. The difference between charging and depot stations lays on the fact that charging nodes are not meant to host vehicles for long periods of time, contrary to depots. The difference can be envisioned as if charging stations were gas stations and depots were bus depots. The  model can be trivially extended according to this distinction. Additionally, it is assumed that the charging stations are all of the same types. It might be argued that some stations might have different types of chargers. This characteristics can be reflected by the model simply by 'splitting' them. A station having, for instance, two types of chargers can be represented by two equivalent nodes in the graph having different category. Moreover, while in \tabref{tab:charging_stations} we only considered three modes, this can be easily extended. 


\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:prob_form}
Before defining the problems for the different challenges faced by the AToD considered in this work, it is essential to lay down the motivations behind certain assumptions made during the conceptual phase. \\
Firstly, following the previously described model, it is assumed that each vehicle starts and ends at a charging or depot node, $\underline{s_a} \text{ and }\bar{t_a}$, which do not have to be necessarily the same. Furthermore, if a vehicle leaves from a depot, it is assumed to have a fully charged battery, i.e. $B_a(0) = 100$. 
%WE ASSUME THE CHARGE OF THE VEHICLE TO BE ENOUGH FOR ALL 
%REQUESTS, CHARGIN CAN ONLY BE DONE BEFORE REBALANCING, 
%THEREFORE WE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS PROBLEM TO ASSIGNMENT.

	\label{fig:sens_assignment}
\end{figure}

Informally, the dispatching problem can be defined as the task of assigning requests to the most suitable vehicle. There exist already multiple solutions proposed for the problem and we refer to \chapref{ch:related_work} for a more thorough analysis. \\
Dispatching is critical for the overall system performance and must be done in a way that can further facilitate the next steps. Clearly, dispatching can not be decoupled and solved as a stand-alone problem. For example, \figref{fig:sens_assignment} shows a simplified situation where a sensible dispatching, which depends on a posterior step, will improve system performance. Nevertheless, during the dispatching problem, some additional elements must be considered as well. \\
Since the model proposed in \secref{sec:vc_model} is a vehicle centric model, we can model the dispatching problem with the help of a binary variable $x_{ar}$ defined in \equaref{eq:dispatching_var}. 
\begin{equation*}
	x_{a,r} = 
	\begin{cases} 
		%0 & \text{if } t+1 \leq 0 \\
		%B(t)_a + \int_{t}^{t+1} i(t)dt & \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
		1 & \quad \text{if $r$ is assigned to } a \in \mathcal{A}\\
		\\
		%R^+_a e^{-t+b_a} %& \text{else}
		0
	\end{cases}
	\quad\quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}
	\label{eq:dispatching_var}
\end{equation*}

According to the model, each vehicle has a capacity which must not be exceeded. Such constraint can be expressed as follows for both people and goods. 
\begin{align}
	\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} P_r' \cdot x_{a,r} &\leq P_a \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:cons_quantity_p}\\
	\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} G_r' \cdot x_{a,r} &\leq G_a \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:cons_quantity_g}
\end{align}
Furthermore, if a vehicle is already on the move, the request can be picked up only if the vehicle's charge is enough to satisfy such request as well. In this case, such requirement can be expressed as follows. 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} e(\underline{s'_r}, \bar{t'_r}) x_{a,r}\leq B_a \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\\
	\label{eq:cons_charg}
\end{equation}
where $e: \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is a function expressing the required energy to go from $\underline{s'_r}$ to $\bar{t'_r}$.\\
Accordingly, using \equaref{eq:cons_quantity_p}, \ref{eq:cons_quantity_g}  and  \equaref{eq:cons_charg}, one can simply formulate it as an integer programming problem by finding the appropriate cost function to minimize, such as minimizing waiting times. Thanks to this formulation, one can also make sure that each request has been served at most $\lambda_r$ times , i.e. \equaref{eq:req_served}. 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} x_{a,r} \leq \lambda_r \quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}\\
	\label{eq:req_served}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, one must ensure that each request is assigned at most to one vehicle. This is expressed by \equaref{eq:req_served_per_vehicle}. 
\begin{equation}
	% \lambda_r
	\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} x_{a,r} \leq 1\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\\
	\label{eq:req_served_per_vehicle}
\end{equation}
The above mentioned equations are based upon the work developed by \citepaperofs{hyland2018dynamic}{Hyland}. \\
This way allows to define the following cost function which expresses the number of served requests. \footnote{To align with subsequent formulations more seamlessly, the objective is to minimize the negative sum rather than maximizing it.}
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{J}_s = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} -x_{a,r}\\
	\label{eq:req_served_cfunction}
\end{equation}

 The main strength of this approach is that can be integrated naturally in the formulation for the other steps, like for e.g. the one in \secref{sec:routing}. \\
Alternatively, the dispatching problem can be solved independently without being integrated in other steps. For example, in \secref{ch:related_work}, some works are mentioned that make use of heuristics such as nearest neighbours. On the one hand,these approaches are known to obtain sub-optimal solutions for the problem; on the other hand, they provide flexibility and might result in less time or space complexity. \\


\subsection{Routing}\label{sec:routing}
After being assigned to incoming requests, vehicles must be routed in such a way that can reach all customers and therefore satisfy all the requests. In other words, the routing problem consists of determining paths, i.e. a series of edges, each vehicle must travel in the graph to fulfill the requests while respecting all the requirements and minimizing some metrics, i.e. a cost function. Since this problem can be reconduced to the
vehicle routing problem, in particular dynamic pickup and delivery problems (reviewd by \citepaperofs{TothPVigoD2014}{Toth} and \citepaperofs{LaporteG2009}{Laporte}), the formulation used in this work will be based on this family of problems. \\
Within our model, binary flow variables will be used to identify whether a vehicle should traverse a link. Formally, this can be expressed as 
\begin{equation*}
	V_{u,v}^a = 
	\begin{cases} 
		%0 & \text{if } t+1 \leq 0 \\
		%B(t)_a + \int_{t}^{t+1} i(t)dt & \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
		1 & \quad \text{if $a$ traverses } (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}\\
		\\
		%R^+_a e^{-t+b_a} %& \text{else}
		0
	\end{cases}
	\quad\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \forall u,v \in \mathcal{V}
	\label{eq:binary_edges}
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, another variable will be needed to deal with time-related requirements. This concept is based on the work in \cite{inbook_twvrp}. The decision variable $s_{u}^a$ indicates the service time of vehicle $a$ at node $u$. This  variable will be relevant only for nodes labeled as being terminal stations for the requests, i.e. $\underline{t'a}$ and will be irrelevant for other nodes. \\
Accordingly, one can express the abovementioned cost function using this variable. Classical examples of cost functions are for e.g. travel time and travel distance. These are frequently used in literature (\cite{7579135}), as they are general, in a sense that many other metrics could be reconducted to them. For example, residual charging or operational costs are directly influenced by the two. Furthermore, the formualtion of the cost function derived from these metrics is rather trivial and intuitive, while at the same time producing desirable results in practice. The formulation is described in equation \equaref{eq:travel_time_routing} and \ref{eq:distance_time_routing}. \\
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{J}_T = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} &\sum_{(u, v) \in \mathcal{E}} T^a_{ u,v} V^a_{u,v} \label{eq:travel_time_routing}\\
	\mathcal{J}_d = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} &\sum_{(u, v) \in \mathcal{E}} d_{ u,v} V^a_{u,v}\label{eq:distance_time_routing}
\end{align} 
In the effort to minimize the environmental impact of the AToD system, the pollution index discussed in previous sections can be utilized to formulate the cost function outlined in \equaref{eq:pollution_metric}.
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{J}_f =\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{(u, v) \in \mathcal{E}} f^a_{ u,v} V^a_{u,v} 
	\label{eq:pollution_metric}
\end{equation} 
Up to this point, the metrics under consideration have been geared towards minimization. Put differently, the goal is to reduce travel, encompassing both distance and time, to enhance system performance. Likewise, minimizing environmental impact is crucial in this scenario. However, there are instances where maintaining certain metrics at higher levels is preferable. For instance, closely tied to operational costs and environmental impact, it is advantageous to keep the state of charge at its maximum. Hence, it is imperative to maximize the cost function in Equation \ref{eq:soc_metric}.
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{J}_B =\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}  B_a 
	\label{eq:soc_metric}
\end{equation} 
Finally, while it should also be explored whether the combination of those could improve the overall performance of the system. For this purpose, the cost functions can be combinated using weights as follows.  
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{J}_{tot} = \lambda_T\mathcal{J}_T +\lambda_d\mathcal{J}_d +\lambda_f\mathcal{J}_f +\lambda_B\mathcal{J}_B 
	\label{eq:combined_metrics}
\end{equation} \\
where $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{R}$ with $i \in \{T, d,f, B\}$ are the weights.\\
It is not uncommon to also find in literature cost functions which are developed in terms of operational costs, as it provides a general idea to reason about this problem and allows for a systematic evaluation of different dispatching strategies. Moreover, the inclusion of operational costs in the literature emphasizes the real-world impact of dispatching decisions, aligning theoretical models with practical considerations. This connection to tangible costs not only enhances the applicability of proposed solutions but also contributes to the development of more realistic and effective dispatching strategies. Considering that, within our model in \secref{sec:vc_model}, each vehicle is modeled to have an operational cost, one can also derive a cost function similarly to what already done in \cite{project_thesis}. 
\subsubsection*{Unconstrained Version}
Before formulating the routing problem formally, a small consideration must be made. For convenience, the set of nodes recheable from node $u$ by traversing a single edge $\mathcal{N}^+_u$, i.e. the ingoing neighbours of $u$, and $\mathcal{N}^-_u$ as the set of outgoing neighbours of $u$.\\ Additionally, in order to ease the notation, the set containin all the initial stations of each request $r \in R_a$ will be indicated as $\underline{S_a'}$. Likewise,  $\bar{T_a'}$ will be the set of terminal stations of each request $r \in R_a$. \\
On a basic level, i.e. without constraints, one can formulate the \textit{Unconstrained Routing Problem (URP)} as follows. \\
\begin{algori}{\textit{(URP)}}
	Given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$ and a set of vehicles $\mathcal{A}$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model}, solve:
\end{algori}


\begin{align}
	\text{min}&  \text{
	(\ref{eq:travel_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:distance_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:pollution_metric}) or (\ref{eq:combined_metrics})

&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{V}} V^a_{u, v} - \sum_{w \in \mathcal{V}} V^a_{v, w} = 0 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, v \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{\underline{s_a}, \bar{t_a}\} \label{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u} \\
&\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s_a}} }V^a_{ \underline{s_a},u} = 1 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u}\\

&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_r}} } V^a_{ \underline{s'_a},u} = 1 \quad \forall r \in \bar{R_a}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_v_u}\\

&{g^a_u - g^a_v + G_a \cdot V_{u,v} \leq G_{a} - \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}}G'_r, \quad \forall u, v \in \mathcal{V}, v \neq u, v \neq \underline{s}_a}\label{eq:no_sub_tour_p}\\
&g^a_u \leq P_a;\quad p^a_u \leq P_a,   \quad\forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:final_req}\\
%& V^a_{u,\underline{s'_a}} \ge  V^a_{\bar{t'_a}, v} \quad \forall u\in \mathcal{N}^-_{\underline{s'_a}}, \forall v \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\bar{t'_a}} , \forall (\underline{s'_a}, \bar{t'_a}) \in R_a, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:s_before_t}
\nonumber
\end{align}



(\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u}) insures that for all edges which do not lead to a source or destination, if $a$ reaches $v$ from a road, an incoming flow will lead to an outgoing one. In other words, they guarantee connections between roads. (\ref{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u}) -  (\ref{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_u}) insure that each universal source and destination is reached ones. Similarly, (\ref{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_v_u}) -  (\ref{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_v_u}) achieves the same result, but for each requests.  It should be mentioned that to guarantee that those special nodes are reached at most once one can simply change from equalities to inequalites, like for e.g. $\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s_a}} }V^a_{ \underline{s_a},u} \ge 1$.\\
Finally, (\ref{eq:no_sub_tour_g})-(\ref{eq:final_req}) assure that no sub-tour are presentes. This is inspired from the Miller-Tucker-Zemli formulation and utilizes two continuous decision variables $p^a, g^a \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ representing the cumulative load of the vehicle $a$. 

%Finally, (\ref{eq:s_before_t}) insures that source nodes are reached before the destinations. \\
In order to find the minimum number of vehicles required, one can use the method described \citepaperof{project_thesis}{Brodo}. 
\subsubsection*{Constrained Version}
While it could bring some interesting insights, the URP does not contain the necessary information to provide efficient routing for the scenario considered in this work. The goal is to identify the best possible path that \textup{(i)} satisfies all the requests and \textup{ii} is congestion free. The \textit{Congestion-Free Routing Problem (CRR)} is formally defined as follows.\\ 
\begin{algori}{\textit{(CRR)}}
	Given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$ and a set of vehicles $\mathcal{A}$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model}, solve:
\end{algori}


\begin{align}
	\text{min}&  
		(\ref{eq:travel_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:distance_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:pollution_metric}) \text{ or } (\ref{eq:combined_metrics})
	\nonumber\\
	\text{s.t.} &\nonumber\\
	&(\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u})-(\ref{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_v_u})\nonumber\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}V^a_{u,v} \leq c_{u,v} \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E} \label{eq:cong_free}\\
	&s_{u}^a + T_{u,v}^a - M*(1-V^a_{u,v}) \leq s_{v}^a  \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:relations_node_time}\\
	%&V^a_{u,v}\cdot(s_{u}^a + T_{u,v}^a - s_{v}^a) \leq 0 \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:relations_node_time}\\
	&a'_v \leq s_{v}^a \leq b'_v \quad \forall v \in \mathcal{E}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:time_window_constraint}\\
	&\sum_{(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}}e^a_{u,v}\cdot V^a_{u,v} \leq B_a(0)\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:discharging_constraints}\\
	&M= \underset{(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}}{\text{max}}\{b_u + T_{u,v}-a_u\}\nonumber
\end{align} 
(\ref{eq:cong_free}) insures the number of vehicles in the link $(u,v)$ do not exceed the capacity of that link. (\ref{eq:relations_node_time}) establishes the relationship between the service time of each node, implying that the service time of a predecessor must be lower than the successor. (\ref{eq:time_window_constraint}) establish the time window constraints, indicating that it must be within the interval of the request. For nodes which are not associated with a termination node of a  request, one will simply set $a_v' = 0 $ and $b_a' = \infty$, also insuring that $s_v^a \ge 0 $. (\ref{eq:discharging_constraints}) assures that the vehicle charge is enough to cover all path. $B_a(0)$ can be assumed to be 100, i.e. that the batteries are full at the beginning of service. \\
In this formulation, the sub-tour elimination constraint is not required at it is already imposed by (\ref{eq:relations_node_time}). \\
\subsubsection*{Combination with Dispatching}
Multiple solutions have already been proposed in literature which solve the dispatching and routing problem in the same work. \\
In this work, however, in order to combine dispatching and routing into the same formulation, one must adapt some of the conditions specified in previous sections above. More specifically, each equation related to the requests must be changed to accomodate the fact that requests have not been previously assigned. \\
Accordingly, the \textit{Routing and Dispatching Problem (RDR)} can be formulated as follows. 

\begin{algori}{\textit{(RDR)}}
	Given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$, a set of vehicles $\mathcal{A}$ and a set of requests $\mathcal{R}$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model}, solve:
	\label{RDR}
\end{algori}

\begin{align}
	\text{min}&  
		(\ref{eq:req_served_cfunction}),
		(\ref{eq:travel_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:distance_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:pollution_metric}) \text{ or } (\ref{eq:combined_metrics})

	&(\ref{eq:cong_free})-(\ref{eq:discharging_constraints})\nonumber\\
	&\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s_a}} }V^a_{ \underline{s_a},u} = 1 \quad r \in \mathcal{R},  \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u_d}\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t_a}} } V^a_{u, \bar{t_a}} = 1 \quad r \in \mathcal{R},  \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_u_d}\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\underline{t'_r}} } V^a_{u, \bar{t'_r}} \ge x_{a,r} \quad  \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:must_arrive_dep}	\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_r}} } V^a_{ \underline{s'_r}, u} \ge x_{a,r} \quad   \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:must_go_start}\\
	%&x_{a,r}\cdot(s_{\underline{s'_r}}^a - s_{\bar{t'_r}}^a) \leq 0 \quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:pick_bef_del}\\
	\nonumber
	%& V^a_{u,\underline{s'_a}} \ge  V^a_{\bar{t'_a}, v} \quad \forall u\in \mathcal{N}^-_{\underline{s'_a}}, \forall v \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\bar{t'_a}} , \forall (\underline{s'_a}, \bar{t'_a}) \in R_a, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:s_before_t}
\end{align}
Constraints (\ref{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u_d}) and (\ref{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_u_d}) impose that a vehicle must leave the starting depot and reach its final depot, respectively.  (\ref{eq:must_arrive_dep}) guarantees that, when a request $r$ is allocated to vehicle $a$, the vehicle must reach the terminal station of the request at least once. Moreover, equation (\ref{eq:must_go_start}) ensures that the vehicle traverses the starting station associated with the assigned request. \\
These requirements, furtermore, with this formulation, also ensure that a vehicle can only move from one node to the other only if they left the starting depot as well. \\ 
As an alternative to (\ref{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u_d}) and (\ref{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_u_d}), one can also relate the two constraints to the request assignment, which would transform the requirements as following. 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	&\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s_a}} }V^a_{ \underline{s_a},u} = \underset{ r \in \mathcal{R}}{\max}\{x_{a,r}\} \quad  \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\\ %\label{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_u_d2}\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t_a}} } V^a_{u, \bar{t_a}} = \underset{ r \in \mathcal{R}}{\max}\{x_{a,r}\}  \quad r \in \mathcal{R},  \forall a \in \mathcal{A}
\end{aligned}
 \label{eq:alternative_constraint_depots}
\end{equation}
\\
In other words, a vehicle must leave the starting depot and reach the final depot if a request is assigned to it. \\
One can argue that the CRR can be reformulate to solve the dispatching in a different way. \\
Let 

\begin{equation*}
	x_{a,\underline{s_r} }= 
	\begin{cases} 
		%0 & \text{if } t+1 \leq 0 \\
		%B(t)_a + \int_{t}^{t+1} i(t)dt & \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
		1 & \quad \text{if $\underline{s_r} $ is reached by }  a \in \mathcal{A}\\
		\\
		%R^+_a e^{-t+b_a} %& \text{else}
		0
	\end{cases}
	\quad\quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}
	\label{eq:var_dispatching}
\end{equation*}

 and given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$, a set of vehicles $\mathcal{A}$ and a set of requests $\mathcal{R}$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model}, solve:\\
\begin{align}
	\text{min}&

	%&(\ref{eq:no_sub_tour_g})-(\ref{eq:final_req})\nonumber\\
	&\sum_{ a \in \mathcal{A} }
	\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_r}} } \alpha_a \cdot V^a_{ \underline{s'_r}, u} \ge \alpha'_r \quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}, \forall \alpha \in \{G, P\}	\label{eq:leaving_from_starting_req}\\
	&\sum_{ a \in \mathcal{A} }\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_r}} } V^a_{ \underline{s'_r}, u} =\lambda_r\quad \forall r \in \mathcal{R}	\label{eq:each_request_ones}\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_r}} }  V^a_{ \underline{s'_r}, u} \leq \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t'_r}} }  V^a_{u,\bar{t'_r}} \label{eq:first_start}

\end{align}
(\ref{eq:leaving_from_starting_req}) insures that request can be served by the vehicle according to its capacity. (\ref{eq:each_request_ones}) guarantees each request is served $\lambda_r$ times and (\ref{eq:first_start}) insures that each vehicle reaches the terminal station of each request. 
\subsection{Rebalancing}\label{sec:rebal}
In simpler terms, the rebalancing problem revolves around efficiently redistributing autonomous vehicles (AVs) to optimize their responsiveness to new ride requests while minimizing any existing imbalances in the system. The goal is to fine-tune the positioning of AVs, ensuring they are strategically placed to promptly meet user demands and address any inherent irregularities in the distribution of service requests. This challenge is particularly crucial in ride-sharing  systems and transportation systems alike, where the dynamic nature of user requests and varying demand across different locations can lead to imbalances in the fleet's distribution. Effectively tackling the rebalancing problem enhances the overall efficiency of the system, providing users with quicker response times and a more evenly distributed service, ultimately contributing to a smoother and more reliable autonomous transportation network. \\
The formulation of the rebalancing problem is partially inspired from the works of \citepaperofs{congestion_vrp_phd_graph}{Zhang} and \citepaperofs{8593743}{Wallar}.  \\
The model previosuly described allows to reason on the rebalancing model in a novel manner when compared to the literature reviewed in \chapref{ch:related_work}. More specifically one could deal with the rebalancing by leveraging the request arrival rate $\lambda_r$ and the fact that vehicles are assumed to have a starting and terminal station, $\underline{s_a}$ and $\bar{t_a}$ respectively. \\

	\label{fig:division_graph}
\end{figure}
Considering the situation depicted in \figref{fig:division_graph} with a set of requests $\mathcal{R}'$ and a sets of vehicles $\mathcal{A}'$. According to this example, the graph is contained within the space $\Omega$, which has been divided in three cells (in red, blue and green). This division has been done arbitrarily in this case, but different strategies can be used (\cite{8593743}, \cite{voronoi_part}). These regions must be specified, however, in such a way that they contain exactly one node belonging to $\mathcal{V}_c$ and more than $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 1}$ nodes belonging to $\mathcal{V}_n$. Informally, this means that those regions are build around each charging station or depot and contain a certain amount of normal nodes. Different strategies could be used to determin this amount, like for e.g. all the nodes within a radius $r$ from each terminal node or within a driving distance $T_{max}$. Nevertheless, as a result of this, one will obtain a set of regions $R$. Formally, each region around a node $v \in \mathcal{V}_c$ can be defined as a subgraph $\mathcal{G}_v = \langle \mathcal{V}'_v, \mathcal{E}'_v\rangle$, where  \\
\begin{align}
\mathcal{V}_v' &= \{ u \in \mathcal{V}_n : (u, v) \in \mathcal{E} \wedge (v, u) \in \mathcal{E} , f(v,u) = 1 \} \cup \{ v\} \label{eq:v_prim_def}\\
\mathcal{E}'_v &= \{ (u, w) \in \mathcal{E} : u, w \in \mathcal{V}' \} 
\end{align}
In (\ref{eq:v_prim_def}), the function $f :  \mathcal{V}_c \times \mathcal{V}_n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is used to establish whether a node $u$ belongs to the region of $v$ ($f(v,u) = 1$) or not ($f(v,u) = 0$), as discussed before. Accordingly, one can obtain the total number of requests of region $v$ ($|\mathcal{R}'_v|$) by considering the requests which have a terminal node in $\mathcal{V}_n$. In other words
\begin{equation}
|\mathcal{R}'_v| = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}_v'} \lambda_r
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_v'= \{ r \in \mathcal{R} : \underline{s_r}' \in \mathcal{V'}_v \} \label{eq:req_per_reg}
\end{equation}
In simple words, the set of $\mathcal{R}_v'$ indicates all the requests that start within the region of the node $v \in \mathcal{V}_c$. \\
Analogally, one can provide an alternative definition for $\mathcal{R}_v'$ in terms of the terminal station $u$.
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{R}_u'= \{ r \in \mathcal{R} : \bar{t_r}' = u \}%\in \mathcal{V'}_v \} 
\end{equation}
Requests, therefore, are distributed over those regions and it is not hard to envision scenarios where requests are unequally distributed, i.e. regions with a higher $|\mathcal{R}^v| $ than others. As a result, due to the heterogenous nature of the nodes and the requests, AToD might experience imbalance, as AVs can be scattered through the whole graph if requests have different terminal nodes. Conversely, the opposite might happen, if all the requests have the same terminal node, but start from different areas. \\ 
Assuming all the requests in $\mathcal{R}'$ to be served, each vehicle's starting position is now either D, E, or F, i.e. $\underline{s_a} \in \{D, E, F\} \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}'$. This is due to the fact that, according to the transportation network model, since the requests have all been served, the vehicles have all reached their previous ending stations $\bar{t}_a$, which became their new starting nodes. \\
As a result, the solution of the rebalancing problem becomes ensuring that there is a sufficient number of vehicles at the depot (or charging) nodes to fulfill as many requests as possible in the given area, potentially covering all requests.
%. Assuming, within set of requests $\mathcal{R}'$, a set of terminal nodes  $\bar{T_r}$ and a set of rates $\Lambda$. \\

\subsubsection*{Unconstrained Rebalancing Problem}
To formulate the different versions of the rebalancing problem binary flow variables will be introduced to help with the different formulations. Similarly to \secref{sec:routing}, those variables will be useed to indicate whether an idle vehicle, i.e. a vehicle not currently transporting customers or goods, should be moving from a node to another. Formally, this is expresseed as follows. 
\begin{equation*}
	y_{u,v}^a = 
	\begin{cases} 
		%0 & \text{if } t+1 \leq 0 \\
		%B(t)_a + \int_{t}^{t+1} i(t)dt & \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
		1 & \quad \text{if $a$ traverses } (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}\\
		\\
		%R^+_a e^{-t+b_a} %& \text{else}
		0
	\end{cases}
	\quad\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \forall u,v \in \mathcal{V}
	\label{eq:binary_edges_reb}
\end{equation*}
Within the assumptions made at the beginning of this section, it follows that a vehicle will be considered idle if it is currently at its final station. \\
For the sake of simplicity and brevity, a generic cost function $\mathcal{J'}$ will be considered for the entirity of this section since the choice of a cost function is similar to the one for \secref{sec:vc_model}. \\
Finally, within the model established in prior sections, the \textit{Unconstrained Rebalancing Problem (UReP)} can be formulated as following. \\
\begin{algori}{\textit{(UReP)}}
	Given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$, a set of idle vehicles $\mathcal{A'}$ and a set of nodes belonging to $ \mathcal{V}_c$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model}, solve:
\end{algori}





\begin{align}
	\text{min}&  \quad \mathcal{J'} \nonumber \\
	\text{s.t.} &\nonumber\\
	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{V}} y^a_{u, v} - \sum_{w \in \mathcal{V}} y^a_{v, w} = 0 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A'}, v \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{\underline{s_a}, \bar{t_a}\} \label{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u23} \\	
	&\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s_a}} }y^a_{ \underline{s_a},u} = 1 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A'} \label{eq:each_vehicle_start}\\
	&\sum_{\bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c}\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t}} }y^a_{u, \bar{t}} = 1 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A'},  \label{eq:each_vehicle_end}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A'}}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t}} } y^a_{u, \bar{t}} \leq z_{\bar{t}} \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:capacity_depot_respected}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A'}}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t}} } G_a \cdot y^a_{u, \bar{t}} \ge \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R'}_{\bar{t}}} G'_r \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:goods_cap}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A'}}\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t}} } P_a \cdot y^a_{u, \bar{t}} \ge \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R'}_{\bar{t}}} P'_r \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:people_cap}\\
	%&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{t'_a}} } V^a_{u, \bar{t'_a}} = 1 \quad \forall \bar{t'_a} \in \bar{T_a'}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A} 	\label{eq:flow_cons_arrival_graph_v_u}\\
	%&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}^+_{\underline{s'_a}} } V^a_{u, \underline{s'_a}} = 1 \quad \forall \underline{s'_a} \in \underline{S_a'}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}\label{eq:flow_cons_departure_graph_v_u} \\
	\nonumber%
\end{align}
(\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u23}) insures the flow conservation. (\ref{eq:each_vehicle_start}) indicates that the vehicles leave the starting node only from one edge. (\ref{eq:each_vehicle_end}) guarantees a vehicle must reach only one deposit at the time. (\ref{eq:capacity_depot_respected}) insures there the capacity of the deposits is respected. Finally, (\ref{eq:goods_cap}) and (\ref{eq:people_cap}) are used to ensure the vehicles being rebalanced to a certain station have the capacity to fulfill the requests of the area. 

\subsection{Congestion-Free Dispatching, Routing and Rebalancing Problem}
While the previous formulation works for a stand-alone, if one wishes to solve routing, dispatching and rebalancing in one formulation, it would introduce a big number of new variable, which would lead to a unefficient formulation. Assuming that the requests can be estimated, a more efficient formulation can be introduced.\\
Let 
\begin{equation*}
	b_{\bar{t}}^a = 
	\begin{cases} 
		%0 & \text{if } t+1 \leq 0 \\
		%B(t)_a + \int_{t}^{t+1} i(t)dt & \quad \text{if } t \leq  b_a\\
		1 & \quad \text{if $a$ is assigned to }\bar{t} \\
		\\
		%R^+_a e^{-t+b_a} %& \text{else}
		0
	\end{cases}
	\quad\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c
	\label{eq:assignment}
\end{equation*}
the \textit{Congestion-Free Dispatching,Routing and Rebalancing Problem (CDRRP)} can be formulated as follows. \\
\begin{algori}{\textit{(CDRRP)}}
	Given a transportation network $\mathcal{G}$, a set of vehicles $\mathcal{A}$, a set of total requests $\mathcal{R}$, defined within the description in section \secref{sec:vc_model},  and the sets of requests per region $\mathcal{R}'$ following (\ref{eq:req_per_reg}), solve: \\
\end{algori}


\begin{align}
	\text{min}&  
		(\ref{eq:travel_time_routing}), (\ref{eq:distance_time_routing}) \text{ or } (\ref{eq:pollution_metric})

	&\sum_{u \in \mathcal{V}} V^a_{u, v} - \sum_{w \in \mathcal{V}} V^a_{v, w} = 0 \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, v \in \mathcal{V} \setminus \{\underline{s_a}\}\setminus\mathcal{V}_c  \label{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u2} \\	
	&\sum_{ u \in \mathcal{N}^-_{\bar{t}} }V^a_{u, \bar{t}} \ge b_{\bar{t}}^a \quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A},\forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c  \label{eq:each_vehicle_end2}\\
	 &\sum_{\bar{t}\in \mathcal{V}_c} b_{\bar{t}}^a = 1\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A}
	 \label{eq:one_depot_vehicle}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}b_{\bar{t}}^a  \leq z_{\bar{t}} \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:capacity_depot_respected2}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} G_a \cdot b_{\bar{t}}^a \ge \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R'}_{\bar{t}}} G'_r \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:goods_cap2}\\
	&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}P_a \cdot b_{\bar{t}}^a\ge \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R'}_{\bar{t}}} P'_r \quad \forall \bar{t} \in \mathcal{V}_c \label{eq:people_cap2}\\
	\nonumber
	%&\text{(\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u23})-(\ref{eq:people_cap})}\nonumber\\
	%&\sum_{(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}}e^a_{u,v}\cdot (V^a_{u,v} + y^a_{u,v}) \leq B_a(0)\quad \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:discharging_constraints2}\\
	%&\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}(V^a_{u,v} + y^a_{u,v}) \leq c_{u,v} \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E} \label{eq:cong_free2}\\
	%&V^a_{u,v} + y^a_{u,v} \leq 1 \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}, \forall a \in \mathcal{A} \label{eq:either_one_or_the_other}
\end{align}
(\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u2}), similarly to (\ref{eq:flow_conservation_graph_u}), imposes the flow conservation for all nodes except the startind depot and the set of terminal depots. (\ref{eq:each_vehicle_end2}) impose a vehicle to stop at a terminal depot.  (\ref{eq:one_depot_vehicle}) ensures each vehicle can be assigned only to one terminal depot. (\ref{eq:capacity_depot_respected2}) guarantees that the depot parking facility is not exceeded. (\ref{eq:people_cap2}) and (\ref{eq:goods_cap2}) ensure that the vehicles' capacity is enough to serve the next batch of requests. \\
Compared to most of the reviewed literature, the strength of this approach lies in the fact that the rebalancing problem resembles more an assignment problem than routing. As a matter of fact, vehicles are routed in such a way that all the requests are guaranteed to be served and at the same time, the inbalance nature of AToD systems is tackled by ensuring that each region has enough vehicle to deal with future requests. \\
Furthermore, due to its vehicle-centric approach, this formulation offers significant flexibility across several dimensions: (i) it accommodates diverse request types, such as goods or people, (ii) it allows for a wide range of vehicle characteristics and specification, like for e.g. different capacities or dischargin profiles, and (iii) it remains adaptable to various node characteristics, as nodes have different number parking spaces, for example. Simultaneously, it exhibits scalability, with the number of variables increasing linearly in relation to the edges in the graph and the number of vehicles under consideration.

In \subfigref{fig:nyc_rn_info}, red points are used to indicate pick-up stations, while blue delineates drop-off points and green is used to pin-point the fictitious depots. These are obtained by the historical data. Furthermore, pick-up points can also be used as drop-off, and viceversa. \subfigref{fig:nyc_simplified_info} shows the semplified road network consisitnf of only the most important streets. Finally, \subfigref{fig:nyc_simplified_roads} shows the final version of the road network after the application of the minimum spanning tree algorithm.  }
	\label{fig:nyc_rn}
\end{figure}
The main purpose of this use case is to demonstrate the applicability of the model in the real world and the feasibility of the solutions presented in \secref{sec:prob_form}. This use case is based on real-world data extracted from taxi rides in manhattan in 2016 (\cite{Donovan2014}). \\
The data has been prepared in the following way. Since the data retrieved is based on the whole New York City, in order to decrease the complexity, some filters have been applied to only target the Manhattan area. More specifically, the pick-up and drop-off points which were outside of Manhattan have been filtered out. Subsequentially, these pick-up and drop-off points have been clustered in 40 locations. Finally, these locations have been mapped to the real Manhattan road network and the shortest path between five neighbours nodes has been traced in order to create a simplified road network, which can be seen in \figref{fig:nyc_rn}. \\
As a consequence, the complexity of Manhattan's road network has been significantly reduced. Within the context of this project, and specifically in this section, this simplification is deemed acceptable since only proof of concepts are being considered. Furthermore, employing a more intricate representation of the road network would not significantly enhance the objectives at hand. This streamlined approach not only facilitates clearer demonstration of concepts but also expedites the analysis process, enabling a more focused examination of essential elements. Thus, for the current scope of this work, the simplified representation remains suitable and pragmatic.
According to the discussion in \secref{sec:rebal}, the region has been divided in multiple areas as well. This can be observed in \figref{fig:nyc_rn_info}. Although the division in areas it's not explicitely stated, five green-highlited nodes can be observed. These nodes represent depots and have been created to fulfill the same purpose of \secref{sec:rebal}.  In order to improve the performance of the simulation, the road network has been simplified by considering only the most important streets in Manhattan, as shown in \figref{fig:nyc_simplified_info} and \figref{fig:nyc_simplified_roads}. This approach optimizes resources while still providing valuable insights into the model performance. \figref{fig:nyc_simplified_roads} specifically has been obtained by first calculating the shortest path, in terms of distance, of the points highligthed in \figref{fig:nyc_rn_info}. Furthermore, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algoritm (\cite{networkx2021}). The MST is used to calculate the smallest possible connected subtree that spans all the vertices in a given graph. In essence, constructing MST involves iteratively selecting edges with the smallest weight while ensuring that no cycles are formed. This process starts with any arbitrary vertex and gradually expands by adding the lightest edge connected to the existing tree until all vertices are encompassed.\\
While information regarding customer demands are relatively easy to obtain, other data must be crafted or estimated. In particular, details about the constraints outlined in \secref{sec:vc_model} can be challenging to gather as they are often specific to certain scenarios or dependent on external factors not captured by the model. For instance, determining the threshold in the congestion model is complex, especially considering it could easily reach thousands in a densely populated city like NYC. Likewise, the time windows of a request is also very specific to the application. For the rest of this work, this information will be derived from the available data and created, if required. For example, the traveling time for each link $T^a_{u,v}$ can be derived with the assumption of a constant speed. Trivially, since the distance is known, the travelling time can be calculated as follows: \\
\begin{equation}
	T^a_{u,v} = \dfrac{d_{u,v} }{l_{u,v}}
\end{equation}
where $l_{u,v}$ is the speed limit of the link $\langle u,v\rangle$. \\
Although data on customer mobility is readily accessible, obtaining precise information on goods delivery poses a challenge. This includes details on the specific category of goods being transported and the exact dropoff locations. Multiple might be the reasons for it, such as privacy, commercial sensitivity or due to the highly heterougenous nature of this field. Nevertheless, a potential approach to glean insights into goods delivery could involve leveraging publicly accessible datasets such as the GetFood Historical Data (\cite{getfoodnyc}). Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, initiatives like GetFoodNYC have been instrumental in facilitating emergency home food delivery for residents unable to access food through conventional means. Although the data provided does not contain delivery location, this can be simulated by picking a random location within the road network and the quantity can be estimated by the available data.\\
To better estimate the performance of a given system, a specific measure, referred to as $r$ index is introduced. It indicates the ratio of requests served per road used. It expresses, basically, how many requests the vehicles can serve per road used and it is calculated as follows. 
 \begin{equation}
	r = \dfrac{\sum_{a\in \mathcal{A}}\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}}x_{a,r} }{\sum_{(u,v) \in \mathcal{E}} \underset{\sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}}}{\max}\{V^a_{u,v}\}}
	\label{eq:r_index}
\end{equation}
Clearly, if the number of roads used increases, the $r$ index decreases. Viceversa, if the number of requests increases, so does $r$. This measure can be used to better understand how efficiently a road network is used by two approaches. \\
The simulations have been carried out using the CBC (\cite{schumacher2022rcbc}) and Gurabi (\cite{gurobi}) solvers used in combination with PuLP (\cite{dunning2011pulp}) on a 2018 Intel i7 MacbookPro. 

\subsection{Rebalancing-Free Analysis}
This use-case refers to the RDR (\algoref{RDR}) with the alternatives defined in (\ref{eq:alternative_constraint_depots}) and the goal is to serve as many requests as possible, i.e. to minimize the cost function in \equaref{eq:req_served}.  For this use-case, since the rebalancing is not considered, the end depots are chosen randomly at the beginning of the simulation and only the starting and ending depots of transporting vehicles are exchanged at every iteration. As a result, transporting vehicles move from starting to end depot at one iteration and viceversa at the next iteration. Two main aspects are considered, namely charging time and congestion constraints. These two variables, which greatly influence the system's performance, have been varied to analyse how the system behave with \text{(i)} high roads capacity low requests rate, i.e. high charging times, since vehicles can start moving after their battery has been charge with an additional 40\%; \text{(ii)} same road capacity, but high request rate ( additional 5 \% of charging); \text{(iii)} low road capacity and high charging rate; finally \text{(iv)} lower capacity, but higher charging rate. 
 The details of the simulations are shown in \tabref{tab:routingless_simu_details} and the starting distribution of the vehicles in the depot is described in \tabref{tab:routingless_depot_distribution}. The overall performance is summarized in \tabref{tab:routingless_simu_performance}\footnote{Further information can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:additional_info}

		\subfigref{fig:nyc_road_usage} illustrates the utilization of the entire road network during the whole shift without considering road congestions. Road usage is determined by aggregating the total number of vehicles traversing each road segment throughout the shift duration. The most used roads are shown in red, while blue indicates the road as barely been used.   \subfigref{fig:charge_vehicle_baseline} displays the average vehicle charge during the shifts.

\end{figure}

In a system characterized by wide charging times and absence of congestion limits ($c_{u,v} > |\mathcal{A}| \quad \forall (u,v) \in \mathcal{E}$), the performance depicted in \figref{fig:nyc_analysis_no_congestions} unfolds. Notably, the objective isn't focused on minimizing overall travel time (\equaref{eq:travel_time_routing}) or total distance traveled (\equaref{eq:distance_time_routing}), but rather on maximizing the number of served requests. Consequently, vehicles tend to cover more distance. This inclination is further facilitated by the lack of real capacity constraints on roads and the freedom for vehicles to traverse them at any time.\\
As a consequence, the utilization of the road network is uneven, as illustrated in \figref{fig:nyc_road_usage}, where the most-utilized links are highlighted in red. This uneven distribution can be attributed partly to the concentration of drop-off and pick-up points, as well as depots, primarily within downtown Manhattan. However, the presence of a depot uptown causes an area of relatively high vehicles activity, although there are not many relevant location there, as shown in \figref{fig:nyc_simplified_info}. This suggests that if the aim is to mitigate vehicle usage and road congestion, this region shouldn't exhibit high vehicular activity. This consideration becomes significant when addressing rebalancing strategies.  \\
An effective rebalancing strategy might also help improving system's performance. For example, the $r$ index of the simulation two with inverted depot is slightly higher (0.9919). \\
Furthermore, \figref{fig:charge_vehicle_baseline} suggests that most of the vehicles have not been used during the shift. This can be inferred by observing that, for half of the vehicles, the average charge is exactly 100\%, i.e. the same as the starting battery charge. This suggests that the fleet of vehicles could  be reduced in number and maintaining the same capacity. \\
\figref{fig:nyc_analysis_congestions} shows the same metrics for the third simulation. Starting from \figref{fig:nyc_road_usage_cong}, contrary to \figref{fig:nyc_road_usage}, vehicle tend to use the road network less efficiently. As expected, there are still roads that stand out as the most used ones, they still reflect the result obtained previously and it is still to associate with the fact that terminal depots are not assigned properly. What suggests a less efficient road use is the $r$ index. Although more requests can be served in comparison with the approach in simulation two, the vehicles must use more roads than the previous case due to the capacity limits and, therefore, $r$ index is lower.\\
 Furthermore, as shown in \figref{fig:charge_vehicle_baseline_cong}, the fleet is also used differently compared to previous approaches. The distribution of average charge appears to be more uneven compared to \figref{fig:charge_vehicle_baseline} , with some vehicles maintaining an average charge of around 90\%, while others show a charge as low as approximately 20\%. As vehicles don't fully recharge at the end of each shift, their evolution over the simulation period can be observed (\figref{fig:ex_soc_vehicles}). This underscores the varying usage patterns among vehicles. For instance, vehicles like 9 and 13 exhibit consistent usage, evident from their gradually decreasing charge levels. Conversely, vehicles like 1 are seldom utilized. This indicates an improper use of the fleed and it is another aspect that can be further optimized with a proper rebalancing strategy.  \\
 Although the capacity limit is an influencing factor, the performance of simulation 4 suggests that the charging time is more determinant. As a matter of fact, while the road capacity is much lower than any previous case, simulation four still exhibits a more efficient road usage, as indicated by an $r$ index which is comperable to the first simulation.  \\
 As expected, the lowest performance has been obtained on the last simulation, i.e. simulation 5. This situation has underscored the critical role of both charging infrastructure and road capacity in the efficiency and effectiveness of electric vehicle (EV) simulations. With the lowest charging capacity, simulation 5 faces significant challenges in accommodating the charging needs of vehicles, leading to increased downtime and congestion on the road network. Additionally, the constrained road capacity exacerbates these issues, resulting in reduced overall performance compared to other simulations. Moreover, the performance disparity between simulations highlights the interconnected nature of charging infrastructure and road capacity in shaping the efficacy of EV systems. Even with relatively low road capacity, simulation 4's efficient road usage suggests that prioritizing charging time optimization can mitigate some of the challenges posed by limited road space. However, in simulation 5, the combined constraints of charging and road capacity result in a notable degradation of system performance.
