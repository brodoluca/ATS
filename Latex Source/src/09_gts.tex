\chapter{Part 2 - Graph Transformation Theory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use graph theory to automatically add nodes
	\item use graph grammar to explore the design space
\end{itemize}
What we can do with GTs is analyzing the behaviour of the cars to, on the other hand, control the infastructure. That means, traffic lights depending on vehicles. PRoving there will be co congestions. More specifically, you can also start from the nodes and build a graph based on the requests. So you are building the infrastracture from the requests. 

In this regards, if for example you have 4 nodes like that \\
A-B\\
|X| \\
C-D\\

I need to put a traffic light in the middle, which is controlled by the cars and the amount. So basically it gets green or red depending on the vehicles on the roads. 
Furthermore, you can also move based on the pedestrians. 
Also, where to plae charging stations and how to operate them.
